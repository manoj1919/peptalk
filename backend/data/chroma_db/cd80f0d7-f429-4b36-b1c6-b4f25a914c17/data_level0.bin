  
**Example 3:**  
The case of *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure
Inc.,* 600 F.3d 1357, 94 USPQ2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2010), involved a disposable
protective covering for the portion of a hearing aid that is inserted into the ear
canal. The covering was such that it could be readily replaced by a user as needed.  
At the district court, Shure had argued that Hearing
Components‚Äô patents were obvious over one or more of three different combinations of
prior art references. The jury disagreed, and determined that the claims were
nonobvious. The district court upheld the jury verdict, stating that in view of the
conflicting evidence presented by the parties as to the teachings of the references,
motivation to combine, and secondary considerations, the nonobviousness verdict was
sufficiently grounded in the evidence.  
Shure appealed to the Federal Circuit, but the Federal
Circuit agreed with the district court that the jury‚Äôs nonobviousness verdict had been
supported by substantial evidence. Although Shure had argued before the jury that the
Carlisle reference taught an ear piece positioned inside the ear canal, Hearing
Components‚Äô credible witness countered that only the molded duct and not the ear piece
itself was taught by Carlisle as being inside the ear canal. On the issue of combining
references, Shure‚Äôs witness had given testimony described as ‚Äúrather sparse, and lacking
in specific details.‚Äù *Id.* at 1364, 94 USPQ2d at 1397. In
contradistinction, Hearing Components‚Äô witness ‚Äúdescribed particular reasons why one
skilled in the art would not have been motivated to combine the references.‚Äù *Id.* Finally, as to secondary considerations, the Federal Circuit
determined that Hearing Components had shown a nexus between the commercial success of
its product and the patent by providing evidence that ‚Äúthe licensing fee for a covered
product was more than cut in half immediately upon expiration‚Äù of the patent.  
Although the *Hearing Components* case
involves substantial evidence of nonobviousness in a jury verdict, it is nevertheless
instructive for Office personnel on the matter of weighing evidence. Office personnel
routinely must consider evidence in the form of prior art references, statements in the
specification, or declarations under **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** (for cases examined
under the **[AIA
35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**), **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** (for cases examined under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**), or **[1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** (for cases examined either
under the AIA or under pre-AIA law). Other forms of evidence may also be presented
during prosecution. Office personnel are reminded that evidence that has been presented
in a timely manner should not be ignored, but rather should be considered on the record.
However, not all evidence need be accorded the same weight. In determining the relative
weight to accord to rebuttal evidence, considerations such as whether a nexus exists
between the claimed invention and the proffered evidence, and whether the evidence is
commensurate in scope with the claimed invention, are appropriate. The mere presence of
some credible rebuttal evidence does not dictate that an obviousness rejection must
always be withdrawn. See **[MPEP ¬ß 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**. Office personnel must consider the appropriate
weight to be accorded to each piece of evidence. An obviousness rejection should be made
or maintained only if evidence of obviousness outweighs evidence of nonobviousness. See **[MPEP ¬ß
706](s706.html#d0e57969)**, subsection I. (‚ÄúThe standard to be applied in all cases
is the ‚Äòpreponderance of the evidence‚Äô test. In other words, an examiner should reject a
claim if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not
that the claim is unpatentable.‚Äù). **[MPEP ¬ß 716.01(d)](s716.html#d0e92769)** provides further
guidance on weighing evidence in making a determination of patentability.  
**Example 4:**  
*Yita LLC, v MacNeil IP LLC,* 69 F.4th
1356, 2023 USPQ2d 667 (Fed. Cir. 2023) involved consideration of Yita‚Äôs challenge to
MacNeil‚Äôs patent in two *inter partes* reviews (IPRs). In
IPR2020-01139, the Board found the patent claims nonobvious due to MacNeil‚Äôs ‚Äúevidence
of secondary considerations [which was] compelling and indicative of non-obviousness.‚Äù
On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board‚Äôs final written decision.  
MacNeil‚Äôs patent claims were directed to a vehicle floor
tray ‚Äúclosely conforming‚Äù to certain walls of the vehicle foot well, a feature that the
Board recognized was disclosed in one of the asserted prior art references (Rabbe). The
Board had found that MacNeil was entitled to a presumption of nexus because its marketed
vehicle trays embodied the claimed invention and were coextensive with the claims.  
On appeal, the Federal Circuit determined that the
finding of nexus rested on two legal errors: (1) the finding that Rabbe‚Äôs disclosure
needed to but did not establish that close conformance was well-known; and (2) the
misapplication of *WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co.,* 829 F.3d 1317, 119 USPQ2d
1301 (Fed. Cir. 2016), which did not speak to the present situation where the secondary
consideration evidence is linked to an individual element of the claimed invention,
specifically the close-conformity element taught by Rabbe.  
As to the first error, the court determined that their
previous case law made clear that ‚Äúobjective evidence of nonobviousness lacks a nexus if
it exclusively relates to a feature that was ‚Äòknown in the prior art‚Äô‚Äînot necessarily
well-known.‚Äù *Rambus Inc. v. Rea,* 731 F.3d 1248, 1257, 108 USPQ2d 1400
(Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in the original) (quoting *Ormco Corp. v. Align
Technology, Inc.,* 463 F.3d 1299, 1312, 79 USPQ2d 1931 (Fed. Cir. 2006))
(internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the court noted that the finding of
coextensiveness is only relevant to the presumption of nexus and it alone does not
decide the overall nexus question.  
As to the second error, the court determined the
secondary consideration evidence was related solely to the individual element of
close-conformance disclosed in the prior art to Rabbe. This circumstance was different
than the one present in *WBIP* in which no single feature (but only the
combination) was responsible for the secondary consideration evidence.  
The secondary consideration evidence was the only *Graham* factor that the Board deemed to weigh in favor of
nonobviousness. Because the Board determined that an artisan of ordinary skill would
have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to arrive at
the claimed invention with a reasonable expectation of success, the court reversed the
final written decision.

**I.** **ARGUMENT DOES NOT REPLACE EVIDENCE WHERE EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY**  
An argument by the applicant is not evidence unless it is an admission,
in which case, an examiner may use the admission in making a rejection. See **[MPEP ¬ß

admissions as prior art.  
Arguments presented by applicant cannot take the place of evidence in
the record. See *In re De Blauwe,* 736 F.2d 699, 705, 222 USPQ 191, 196
(Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re* *Schulze,* 346 F.2d 600, 602, 145 USPQ 716, 718 (CCPA 1965); *In re Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 43 USPQ2d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (‚ÄúAn
assertion of what seems to follow from common experience is just attorney argument and
not the kind of factual evidence that is required to rebut a *prima
facie* case of obviousness.‚Äù). See **[MPEP ¬ß 716.01(c)](s716.html#d0e92659)** for examples of
applicant statements which are not evidence and which must be supported by an
appropriate affidavit or declaration.  
**II.** **ARGUING ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OR LATENT PROPERTIES**  
-
***Prima Facie Obviousness Is Not Rebutted by Merely Recognizing Additional
Advantages or Latent Properties Present But Not Recognized in the Prior
Art***  
Mere recognition of latent properties in the prior art does not
render nonobvious an otherwise known invention. *In re Wiseman,* 596
F.2d 1019, 201 USPQ 658 (CCPA 1979) (Claims were directed to grooved carbon disc
brakes wherein the grooves were provided to vent steam or vapor during a braking
action. A prior art reference taught noncarbon disc brakes which were grooved for the
purpose of cooling the faces of the braking members and eliminating dust. The court
held the prior art references when combined would overcome the problems of dust and
overheating solved by the prior art and would inherently overcome the steam or vapor
cause of the problem relied upon for patentability by applicants. Granting a patent
on the discovery of an unknown but inherent function (here venting steam or vapor)
‚Äúwould remove from the public that which is in the public domain by virtue of its
inclusion in, or obviousness from, the prior art.‚Äù 596 F.2d at 1022, 201 USPQ at
661.); *In re Baxter Travenol Labs.,* 952 F.2d 388, 21 USPQ2d 1281
(Fed. Cir. 1991) (Appellant argued that the presence of DEHP as the plasticizer in a
blood collection bag unexpectedly suppressed hemolysis and therefore rebutted any *prima facie* showing of obviousness. However, the closest prior
art utilizing a DEHP plasticized blood collection bag inherently achieved same
result, although this fact was unknown in the prior art.).  
‚ÄúThe fact that appellant has recognized another advantage which
would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior art cannot be the
basis for patentability when the differences would otherwise be obvious.‚Äù *Ex
parte Obiaya,* 227 USPQ 58, 60 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985) (The
prior art taught combustion fluid analyzers which used labyrinth heaters to maintain
the samples at a uniform temperature. Although appellant showed that an unexpectedly
shorter response time was obtained when a labyrinth heater was employed, the Board
held this advantage would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior
art.). See also  *Lantech Inc.**v. Kaufman Co. of Ohio Inc.,* 878 F.2d 1446, 12 USPQ2d 1076, 1077
(Fed. Cir. 1989), *cert. denied,* 493 U.S. 1058 (1990) (unpublished
‚Äî not citable as precedent) (‚ÄúThe recitation of an additional advantage associated
with doing what the prior art suggests does not lend patentability to an otherwise
unpatentable invention.‚Äù).  
*In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972) and *In re Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
discussed in **[MPEP
¬ß 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)** are also pertinent to this issue.

declaratory evidence alleging unexpected results.  
**III.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART DEVICES ARE NOT PHYSICALLY COMBINABLE**  
‚ÄúIt is well-established that a determination of obviousness based on
teachings from multiple references does not require an actual, physical substitution of
elements.‚Äù *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1332, 103 USPQ2d 1219, 1226
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing *In re Etter,* 756 F.2d 852, 859, 225 USPQ 1,
6 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (*en banc*)) (‚ÄúEtter's assertions that Azure cannot
be incorporated in Ambrosio are basically irrelevant, the criterion being not whether
the references could be physically combined but whether the claimed inventions are
rendered obvious by the teachings of the prior art as a whole.‚Äù). See also *In
re Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 425, 208 USPQ 871, 881 (CCPA 1981) (‚ÄúThe test for
obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily
incorporated into the structure of the primary reference.... Rather, the test is what
the combined teachings of those references would have suggested to those of ordinary
skill in the art.‚Äù); *In re Sneed,* 710 F.2d 1544, 1550, 218 USPQ 385,
389 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (‚Äú[I]t is not necessary that the inventions of the references be
physically combinable to render obvious the invention under review.‚Äù); and *In
re Nievelt,* 482 F.2d 965, 179 USPQ 224, 226 (CCPA 1973) (‚ÄúCombining the teachings of references does not involve an ability to combine
their specific structures.‚Äù).  
However, the claimed combination cannot change the principle of
operation of the primary reference or render the reference inoperable for its intended
purpose. See **[MPEP
¬ß 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI.  
**IV.** **ARGUING AGAINST REFERENCES INDIVIDUALLY**  
**One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the
rejections are based on combinations of references**. *In re
Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981); *In re Merck &
Co., Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Where a rejection
of a claim is based on two or more references, a reply that is limited to what a subset
of the applied references teaches or fails to teach, or that fails to address the
combined teaching of the applied references may be considered to be an argument that
attacks the reference(s) individually. Where an applicant‚Äôs reply establishes that each
of the applied references fails to teach a limitation and addresses the combined
teachings and/or suggestions of the applied prior art, the reply as a whole does not
attack the references individually as the phrase is used in *Keller* and reliance on *Keller* would not be appropriate. This is because
‚Äú[T]he test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the references would have
suggested to [a PHOSITA].‚Äù *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1333, 103
USPQ2d 1219, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  
**V.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF REFERENCES COMBINED**  
Reliance on a large number of references in a rejection does not,
without more, weigh against the obviousness of the claimed invention. *In re
Gorman,* 933 F.2d 982, 18 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Court affirmed a
rejection of a detailed claim to a candy sucker shaped like a thumb on a stick based on
thirteen prior art references.).  
**VI.** **ARGUING LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE NOT CLAIMED**  
Although the claims are interpreted in light of the specification,
limitations from the specification are not read into the claims. *In re Van
Geuns,* 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Claims to a
superconducting magnet which generates a ‚Äúuniform magnetic field‚Äù were not limited to
the degree of magnetic field uniformity required for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
imaging. Although the specification disclosed that the claimed magnet may be used in an
NMR apparatus, the claims were not so limited.); *Constant v. Advanced
Micro-Devices, Inc.,* 848 F.2d 1560, 1571-72, 7 USPQ2d 1057, 1064-1065 (Fed.
Cir.), *cert. denied,* 488 U.S. 892 (1988) (Various limitations on
which appellant relied were not stated in the claims; the specification did not provide
evidence indicating these limitations must be read into the claims to give meaning to
the disputed terms.); *Ex parte McCullough,* 7 USPQ2d 1889, 1891 (Bd.
Pat. App. & Inter. 1987) (Claimed electrode was rejected as obvious despite
assertions that electrode functions differently than would be expected when used in
nonaqueous battery since ‚Äúalthough the demonstrated results may be germane to the
patentability of a battery containing appellant‚Äôs electrode, they are not germane to the
patentability of the invention claimed on appeal.‚Äù).  
See **[MPEP

relevant to claim interpretation.  
**VII.** **ARGUING ECONOMIC INFEASIBILITY**  
The fact that a "combination would not be made by businessmen for
economic reasons" does not mean that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not
make the combination because of some technological incompatibility. *In re
Farrenkopf,* 713 F.2d 714, 718, 219 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Prior art
reference taught that addition of inhibitors to radioimmunoassay is the most convenient,
but costliest solution to stability problem. The court held that the additional expense
associated with the addition of inhibitors would not discourage one of ordinary skill in
the art from seeking the convenience expected therefrom.).  
**VIII.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE AGE OF REFERENCES**  
‚ÄúThe mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness
of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge
of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.‚Äù *In re
Wright,* 569 F.2d 1124, 1127, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977) (100 year old
patent was properly relied upon in a rejection based on a combination of references.).
See also *Ex parte Meyer,* 6 USPQ2d 1966 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
1988) (length of time between the issuance of prior art patents relied upon (1920 and
1976) was not persuasive of nonobviousness).  
**IX.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART IS NONANALOGOUS**  
See **[MPEP
¬ß 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208985)** for case law pertaining to analogous art.  
**X.** **ARGUING IMPROPER RATIONALES FOR COMBINING REFERENCES**  
-
***A.***  ***Impermissible Hindsight***  
Applicants may argue that the examiner‚Äôs conclusion of obviousness
is based on improper hindsight reasoning. However, ‚Äú[a]ny judgment on obviousness is
in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based on hindsight reasoning, but so long as
it takes into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary skill in
the art at the time the claimed invention was made and does not include knowledge
gleaned only from applicant‚Äôs disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper.‚Äù *In re McLaughlin,* 443 F.2d 1392, 1395, 170 USPQ 209, 212 (CCPA
1971). ‚ÄúA factfinder should be aware, of course, of the distortion caused by
hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. . .
. Rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however,
are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.‚Äù *KSR Int'l
Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007)
(internal quotations omitted). Applicants may also argue that the combination of two
or more references is ‚Äúhindsight‚Äù because ‚Äúexpress‚Äù motivation to combine the
references is lacking. However, there is no requirement that an ‚Äúexpress, written
motivation to combine must appear in prior art references before a finding of
obviousness.‚Äù *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270, 1276, 69
USPQ2d 1686, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 402, 82
USPQ2d at 1389 (‚ÄúThe diversity of inventive pursuits and of modern technology
counsels against confining the obviousness analysis by a formalistic conception of
the words teaching, suggestion, and motivation, or by overemphasizing the importance

USPQ2d 10476 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (‚Äú[W]e hold that the Board erred when it determined

individual.‚Äô This combination does not represent ‚Äòimpermissible hindsight‚Äô‚Ä¶. Rather,
because Okubo's terminal-side plotting and Konishi's server-side plotting were both
well known in the art, and were the only two identified, predictable solutions for
transmitting a map and plotting locations, it would have been obvious to substitute

***B.***  ***Obvious To Try Rationale***  
An applicant may argue the examiner is applying an improper ‚Äúobvious
to try‚Äù rationale in support of an obviousness rejection.  
An ‚Äúobvious to try‚Äù rationale may support a conclusion that a claim
would have been obvious where one skilled in the art is choosing from a finite number
of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success. ‚Äú [A]
person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or
her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely that
product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that
instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was
obvious under **[¬ß

U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007).  
‚ÄúThe admonition that ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô is not the standard under **[¬ß
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** has been directed mainly at two kinds of error. In some
cases, what would have been ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô would have been to vary all parameters
or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at a successful
result, where the prior art gave either no indication of which parameters were
critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be
successful.... In others, what was ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô was to explore a new technology
or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, where the
prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed
invention or how to achieve it.‚Äù *In re O‚ÄôFarrell,* 853 F.2d 894,
903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted) (The court held the
claimed method would have been obvious over the prior art relied upon because one
reference contained a detailed enabling methodology, a suggestion to modify the prior
art to produce the claimed invention, and evidence suggesting the modification would
be successful.).  
***C.***  ***Lack of Suggestion To Combine References***  
A teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine references that is
found in the prior art is an appropriate rationale for determining obviousness. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. However, it is just
one of a number of valid rationales for doing so. The Court in *KSR* identified several exemplary rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness which
are consistent with the proper ‚Äúfunctional approach‚Äù to the determination of
obviousness as laid down in *Graham.**KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415-21, 82 USPQ2d at 1395-97. See **[MPEP ¬ß

***D.***  ***References Teach Away from the Invention or Render Prior Art
Unsatisfactory for Intended Purpose***  
In addition to the material below, see **[MPEP ¬ß 2141.02](s2141.html#d0e209106)** (prior art must be considered in its entirety, including disclosures that teach away
from the claims) and **[MPEP ¬ß 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI (proposed modification
cannot render the prior art unsatisfactory for its intended purpose or change the
principle of operation of a reference).  
**1.** **The Nature of the Teaching Is Highly
Relevant**  
A prior art reference that ‚Äúteaches away‚Äù from the claimed
invention is a significant factor to be considered in determining obviousness.
However, ‚Äúthe nature of the teaching is highly relevant and must be weighed in
substance. A known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply
because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the
same use.‚Äù *In re**Gurley,* 27 F.3d 551, 553, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994)
(Claims were directed to an epoxy resin based printed circuit material. A prior
art reference disclosed a polyester-imide resin based printed circuit material,
and taught that although epoxy resin based materials have acceptable stability and
some degree of flexibility, they are inferior to polyester-imide resin based
materials. The court held the claims would have been obvious over the prior art
because the reference taught epoxy resin based material was useful for the
inventor‚Äôs purpose, applicant did not distinguish the claimed epoxy from the prior
art epoxy, and applicant asserted no discovery beyond what was known to the
art.).  
Furthermore, ‚Äúthe prior art‚Äôs mere disclosure of more than one
alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives
because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the
solution claimed‚Ä¶.‚Äù *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73

UT, Inc.,* 65 F.4th 679, 692, 2023 USPQ2d 448 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (‚Äúa

alternative invention but does not criticize, discredit or otherwise discourage

1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009)); and *Schwendimann v. Neenah, Inc.,* 82 F.4th 1371, 1381, 2023 USPQ2d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (‚ÄúAlthough Oez [the prior

skilled artisan from using the white pigment without a cross-linking polymer or
lead the skilled artisan in a direction divergent from the path taken in the
Appealed Patents. Thus, Oez's disclosure is substantial evidence that supports the
Board's finding that Oez does not teach away from the proposed combination.‚Äù).  
**2.** **References Cannot Be Combined Where Reference Teaches Away from Their
Combination**  
It is improper to combine references where the references teach
away from their combination. *In re Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731,
743, 218 USPQ 769, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (The claimed catalyst which contained both
iron and an alkali metal was not suggested by the combination of a reference which
taught the interchangeability of antimony and alkali metal with the same
beneficial result, combined with a reference expressly excluding antimony from,
and adding iron to, a catalyst.).  
**3.** **Proceeding Contrary to Accepted Wisdom Is Evidence of Nonobviousness**  
The totality of the prior art must be considered, and proceeding
contrary to accepted wisdom in the art is evidence of nonobviousness. *In
re Hedges,* 783 F.2d 1038, 228 USPQ 685 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Applicant‚Äôs
claimed process for sulfonating diphenyl sulfone at a temperature above 127¬∫C was
contrary to accepted wisdom because the prior art as a whole suggested using lower
temperatures for optimum results as evidenced by charring, decomposition, or
reduced yields at higher temperatures.).  
Furthermore, ‚Äú[k]nown disadvantages in old devices which would
naturally discourage search for new inventions may be taken into account in
determining obviousness.‚Äù *United States v. Adams,* 383 U.S. 39,
52, 148 USPQ 479, 484 (1966).  
***E.***  ***Applicability of KSR to All Technologies***  
At the time the *KSR* decision was
handed down, some observers questioned whether the principles discussed were intended
by the Supreme Court to apply to all fields of inventive endeavor. Arguments were
made that because the technology at issue in *KSR* involved the
relatively well-developed and predictable field of vehicle pedal assemblies, the
decision was relevant only to such fields. The Federal Circuit has soundly repudiated
such a notion, stating that *KSR* applies across technologies:
> This court also declines to cabin KSR to the
> ‚Äúpredictable arts‚Äù (as opposed to the ‚Äúunpredictable art‚Äù of biotechnology). In
> fact, this record shows that one of skill in this advanced art would find these
> claimed ‚Äúresults‚Äù profoundly ‚Äúpredictable.‚Äù  
*In re Kubin,* 561 F.3d 1351, 1360, 90 USPQ2d 1417, 1424 (Fed. Cir.
2009). Thus, Office personnel should not withdraw any rejection solely on the basis
that the invention lies in a technological area ordinarily considered to be
unpredictable. See also **[MPEP ¬ß 2143.02](s2143.html#d0e210414)**.

Rebuttal evidence and arguments can be presented in the
specification, *In re Soni,* 54 F.3d 746, 750, 34 USPQ2d 1684, 1687 (Fed.
Cir. 1995), by way of an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**, e.g., *Soni,* 54 F.3d at 750, 34 USPQ2d at 1687; *In re
Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 1474, 223 USPQ 785, 789-90 (Fed. Cir. 1984), or

of factually supported objective evidence. See, e.g., *In re Schulze,* 346
F.2d 600, 602, 145 USPQ 716, 718 (CCPA 1965); *In re De Blauwe,* 736 F.2d
699, 705, 222 USPQ 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  
Office personnel should consider all rebuttal arguments and evidence
presented by applicants. See, e.g.,  *Soni,* 54 F.3d at 750, 34 USPQ2d at
1687 (error not to consider evidence presented in the specification). C.f., *In re
Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1067, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1807 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (‚Äú[W]hen

(Fed. Cir. 1992) (Office personnel should consider declarations from those skilled in the
art praising the claimed invention and opining that the art teaches away from the
invention.); *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1472, 223 USPQ at 788 (‚Äú[Rebuttal
evidence] may relate to any of the *Graham* factors including the
so-called secondary considerations.‚Äù). The Federal Circuit has ‚Äúemphasized that
consideration of the objective indicia is part of the whole obviousness analysis, not just
an afterthought.‚Äù *Leo Pharm. Prod., Ltd. v. Rea,* 726 F.3d 1346, 1357,
107 USPQ2d 1943, 1952 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in original). Even though court decisions
‚Äúhave used the ‚Äòprima facie‚Äô and ‚Äòrebuttal‚Äô language [the decisions have] generally have
made clear that a fact finder must consider *all* evidence of obviousness
and nonobviousness before reaching a determination.‚Äù *In re Cyclobenzaprine
Hydrochloride Extended- Release Capsule Patent Litig.,* 676 F.3d 1063, 1077,
102 USPQ2d 1760, 1772 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (emphasis in the original).  
Rebuttal evidence may include evidence of ‚Äúsecondary considerations,‚Äù such
as ‚Äúcommercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, [and] failure of others.‚Äù *Graham v. John Deere Co.,* 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 4459, 467. See also,
e.g., *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 1473, 223 USPQ 785, 788 (Fed. Cir.
1984) (commercial success). Rebuttal evidence may also include evidence that the claimed
invention yields unexpectedly improved properties or properties not present in the prior
art. Rebuttal evidence may consist of a showing that the claimed compound possesses
unexpected properties. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 692-93, 16 USPQ2d at 1901. A
showing of unexpected results must be based on evidence, not argument or speculation. *In re Mayne,* 104 F.3d 1339, 1343-44, 41 USPQ2d 1451, 1455-56 (Fed.
Cir. 1997) (conclusory statements regarding unusually low immune response or unexpected
biological activity that were unsupported by comparative data held insufficient to overcome *prima facie* case of obviousness). Rebuttal evidence may include
evidence that the claimed invention was copied by others. See, e.g., *In re
GPAC,* 57 F.3d 1573, 1580, 35 USPQ2d 1116, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 1995); *Hybritech Inc.**v. Monoclonal Antibodies,* 802 F.2d 1367, 1380, 231 USPQ 81, 90 (Fed.
Cir. 1986). It may also include evidence of the state of the art, the level of skill in the
art, and the beliefs of those skilled in the art. See, e.g., *In re Oelrich,* 579 F.2d 86, 91-92, 198 USPQ 210, 214 (CCPA 1978) (Expert opinions regarding the
level of skill in the art were probative of the nonobviousness of the claimed invention.); *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1471, 1473-74, 223 USPQ at 790 (Evidence of
nontechnological nature is pertinent to the conclusion of obviousness. The declarations of
those skilled in the art regarding the need for the invention and its reception by the art
were improperly discounted by the Board.); *Beattie,* 974 F.2d at 1313, 24
USPQ2d at 1042-43 (Seven declarations provided by music teachers opining that the art
teaches away from the claimed invention must be considered, but were not probative because
they did not contain facts and did not deal with the specific prior art that was the
subject of the rejection.). For example, rebuttal evidence may include a showing that the
prior art fails to disclose or render obvious a method for making the compound, which would
preclude a conclusion of obviousness of the compound. A conclusion of obviousness requires
that the reference(s) relied upon, together with the knowledge of a person skilled in the
art, be enabling in that it put the public in possession of the claimed invention. *In re Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d 269, 273, 158 USPQ 596, 600 (CCPA 1968)
(citing *In re Le Grice,* 301 F.2d 929, 936, 133 USPQ 365, 372 (CCPA
1962)). The *Hoeksema,* court stated:
> Thus, upon careful reconsideration it is our view that if the prior
> art of record fails to disclose or render obvious a method for making a claimed
> compound, at the time the invention was made, it may not be legally concluded that the
> compound itself is in the possession of the public. [footnote omitted.] In this context,
> we say that the absence of a known or obvious process for making the claimed compounds
> overcomes a presumption that the compounds are obvious, based on close relationships
> between their structures and those of prior art compounds.  
See *Hoeksema*, 399 F.2d at 274, 158 USPQ at 601. The *Hoeksema* court further noted that once a *prima
facie* case of obviousness is made by the USPTO through citation of references,
the burden is on the applicant to produce contrary evidence. In *Hoeksema*, the contrary evidence was that the applied reference did not
disclose or render obvious a process for producing the claimed compounds. *Id.* at 274-75, 158 USPQ at 601. See also *Ashland Oil, Inc.
v. Delta Resins & Refractories, Inc.,* 776 F.2d 281, 295, 297, 227 USPQ
657, 666, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing *Hoeksema* for the proposition
above); *In re Grose,* 592 F.2d 1161, 1168, 201 USPQ 57, 63-64 (CCPA 1979)
("One of the assumptions underlying a prima facie obviousness rejection based upon a
structural relationship between compounds, such as adjacent homologs, is that a method
disclosed for producing one would provide those skilled in the art with a method for
producing the other... Failure of the prior art to disclose or render obvious a method for
making any composition of matter, whether a compound or a mixture of compounds like a
zeolite, precludes a conclusion that the composition would have been obvious.").  
Consideration of rebuttal evidence and arguments requires Office personnel
to weigh the proffered evidence and arguments. *Id.;* see also *In
re Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 1174-75, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
Office personnel should avoid giving no weight to evidence submitted by applicant, except
in rare circumstances. However, to be entitled to substantial weight, the applicant should
establish a nexus between the rebuttal evidence and the claimed invention, i.e., objective
evidence of nonobviousness must be attributable to the claimed invention. The Federal
Circuit has acknowledged that applicant bears the burden of establishing nexus,
stating:
> In the *ex parte* process of examining a patent
> application, however, the PTO lacks the means or resources to gather evidence which
> supports or refutes the applicant‚Äôs assertion that the sales constitute commercial
> success. *C.f. Ex parte Remark,* 15 USPQ2d 1498, 1503 ([BPAI] 1990)
> (evidentiary routine of shifting burdens in civil proceedings inappropriate in *ex parte* prosecution proceedings because examiner has no available
> means for adducing evidence). Consequently, the PTO must rely upon the applicant to
> provide hard evidence of commercial success.  
*In re Huang,* 100 F.3d 135, 139-40, 40 USPQ2d 1685, 1689 (Fed. Cir.
1996). See also *GPAC,* 57 F.3d at 1580, 35 USPQ2d at 1121; *In re
Paulsen,* 30 F.3d 1475, 1482, 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1676 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Evidence
of commercial success of articles not covered by the claims subject to the **[35 U.S.C.
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection was not probative of nonobviousness.). Additionally,
the evidence must be reasonably commensurate in scope with the claimed invention. See,
e.g., *In re Kulling,* 897 F.2d 1147, 1149, 14 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed.
Cir. 1990); *In re Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731, 743, 218 USPQ 769, 777 (Fed.
Cir. 1983). *In re Soni,* 54 F.3d 746, 34 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
does not change this analysis. In *Soni,* the court declined to consider
the Office‚Äôs argument that the evidence of nonobviousness was not commensurate in scope
with the claim because it had not been raised by the examiner. *Id.* 54
F.3d at 751, 34 USPQ2d at 1688.  
In other words, in order for evidence of secondary
considerations to be accorded substantial weight, there must be a nexus, i.e., a legally
and factually sufficient connection or correspondence between the submitted evidence and
the claimed invention. *Fox Factory, Inc. v. SRAM, LLC,* 944 F.3d 1366,
1373, 2019 USPQ2d 483355 (Fed. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 373 (2020). ‚ÄúA
presumption of nexus requires both that the product embodies the invention and is
coextensive with it.‚Äù *Volvo Penta of the Americas, LLC v. Brunswick
Corp.,* 81 F.4th 1202,1211-12, 2023 USPQ2d 1000 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (While Volvo
Penta provided insufficient evidence to show a presumption of nexus, they did provide
sufficient evidence to show nexus, independent of the presumption, through evidence of
commercial success and copying due to the unique features of the claimed invention.). See **[MPEP ¬ß
716.01(b)](s716.html#d0e92626)**.  
When considering whether proffered evidence is commensurate in scope with
the claimed invention, Office personnel should not require the applicant to show
unexpected results over the entire range of properties possessed by a chemical compound or
composition. See, e.g., *In re Chupp,* 816 F.2d 643, 646, 2 USPQ2d 1437,
1439 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Evidence that the compound or composition possesses superior and
unexpected properties in one of a spectrum of common properties can be sufficient to rebut
a *prima facie* case of obviousness. *Id.*  
For example, a showing of unexpected results for a single member of a
claimed subgenus, or a narrow portion of a claimed range would be sufficient to rebut a *prima facie* case of obviousness if a skilled artisan ‚Äúcould ascertain
a trend in the exemplified data that would allow him to reasonably extend the probative
value thereof.‚Äù *In re Clemens,* 622 F.2d 1029, 1036, 206 USPQ 289, 296
(CCPA 1980) (Evidence of the nonobviousness of a broad range can be proven by a narrower
range when one skilled in the art could ascertain a trend that would allow him to
reasonably extend the probative value thereof.). But see, *Grasselli,* 713
F.2d at 743, 218 USPQ at 778 (evidence of superior properties for sodium containing
composition insufficient to establish the non-obviousness of broad claims for a catalyst
with ‚Äúan alkali metal‚Äù where it was well known in the catalyst art that different alkali
metals were not interchangeable and applicant had shown unexpected results only for sodium
containing materials); *In re Greenfield,* 571 F.2d 1185, 1189, 197 USPQ
227, 230 (CCPA 1978) (evidence of superior properties in one species insufficient to
establish the nonobviousness of a subgenus containing hundreds of compounds); *In
re Lindner,* 457 F.2d 506, 508, 173 USPQ 356, 358 (CCPA 1972) (one test not
sufficient where there was no adequate basis for concluding the other claimed compounds
would behave the same way). However, an exemplary showing may be sufficient to establish a
reasonable correlation between the showing and the entire scope of the claim, when viewed
by a skilled artisan. See, e.g., *Chupp,* 816 F.2d at 646, 2 USPQ2d at
1439; *Clemens,* 622 F.2d at 1036, 206 USPQ at 296. On the other hand,
evidence of an unexpected property may not be sufficient regardless of the scope of the
showing. Usually, a showing of unexpected results is sufficient to overcome a *prima facie* case of obviousness. See, e.g., *In re
Albrecht,* 514 F.2d 1389, 1396, 185 USPQ 585, 590 (CCPA 1975). However, where
the claims are not limited to a particular use, and where the prior art provides other
motivation to select a particular species or subgenus, a showing of a new use alone may not
be sufficient to confer patentability. See *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 692, 16
USPQ2d at 1900-01. Accordingly, each case should be evaluated individually based on the
totality of the circumstances.  
Evidence pertaining to secondary considerations must be taken into
account whenever it has been properly presented; however, it does not necessarily control
the obviousness conclusion. See, e.g., *Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc.,* 480
F.3d 1348, 1372, 82 USPQ2d 1321, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (‚Äúthe record establish[ed] such a
strong case of obviousness‚Äù that allegedly unexpectedly superior results were ultimately
insufficient to overcome obviousness conclusion); *Leapfrog Enterprises Inc. v.
Fisher-Price Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 1162, 82 USPQ2d 1687, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
(‚Äúgiven the strength of the *prima facie* obviousness showing, the
evidence on secondary considerations was inadequate to overcome a final conclusion‚Äù of
obviousness); and *Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney Mfg. Co.,* 864 F.2d 757,
768, 9 USPQ2d 1417, 1426 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Office personnel should not evaluate rebuttal
evidence for its ‚Äúknockdown‚Äù value against the *prima facie* case, *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1473, 223 USPQ at 788, or summarily dismiss it
as not compelling or insufficient. Office personnel should weigh all relevant evidence of
record in order to determine whether the claims would have been obvious based on a
preponderance (more likely than not) standard, and then explain their conclusions. See **[MPEP ¬ß
716](s716.html#d0e92085)** - **[¬ß 716.10](s716.html#d0e93797)** for additional information
pertaining to the evaluation of rebuttal evidence submitted under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**.  
The following cases exemplify the continued application of
the principle that when evidence has been presented to rebut an obviousness rejection, it
should not be evaluated simply for its ‚Äúknockdown‚Äù value. Rather, all evidence must be
reweighed to determine whether the claims are nonobvious.  
**Example 1:**  
The claims at issue in *PharmaStem Therapeutics,
Inc. v. Viacell, Inc.,* 491 F.3d 1342, 83 USPQ2d 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2007), were
directed to compositions comprising hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord or
placental blood, and to methods of using such compositions for treatment of blood and
immune system disorders. The composition claims required that the stem cells be present
in an amount sufficient to effect hematopoietic reconstitution when administered to a
human adult. The trial court had found that PharmaStem‚Äôs patents were infringed and not
invalid on obviousness or other grounds. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the
district court, determining that the claims were invalid for obviousness.  
The Federal Circuit discussed the evidence presented at
trial. It pointed out that the patentee, PharmaStem, had not invented an entirely new
procedure or new composition. Rather, PharmaStem‚Äôs own specification acknowledged that
it was already known in the prior art that umbilical cord and placental blood-based
compositions contained hematopoietic stem cells, and that hematopoietic stem cells were
useful for the purpose of hematopoietic reconstitution. PharmaStem‚Äôs contribution was to
provide experimental proof that umbilical cord and placental blood could be used to
effect hematopoietic reconstitution in mice. By extrapolation, one of ordinary skill in
the art would have expected this reconstitution method to work in humans as well.  
The court rejected PharmaStem‚Äôs expert testimony that
hematopoietic stem cells had not been proved to exist in cord blood prior to the
experiments described in PharmaStem‚Äôs patents. The court explained that the expert
testimony was contrary to the inventors‚Äô admissions in the specification, as well as
prior art teachings that disclosed stem cells in cord blood. In this case, PharmaStem‚Äôs
evidence of nonobviousness was outweighed by contradictory evidence.  
Despite PharmaStem‚Äôs useful experimental validation of
hematopoietic reconstitution using hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord and
placental blood, the Federal Circuit found that the claims at issue would have been
obvious. There had been ample suggestion in the prior art that the claimed method would
have worked. Absolute predictability is not a necessary prerequisite to a case of
obviousness. Rather, a degree of predictability that one of ordinary skill would have
found to be reasonable is sufficient. The Federal Circuit concluded that ‚Äú[g]ood science
and useful contributions do not necessarily result in patentability.‚Äù *Id.* at 1364, 83 USPQ2d at 1304.  
**Example 2:**  
It was found to be an error in *In re
Sullivan,* 498 F.3d 1345, 84 USPQ2d 1034 (Fed. Cir. 2007), for the Board to
fail to consider evidence submitted to rebut a *prima facie* case of
obviousness.  
The claimed invention was directed to an antivenom
composition comprising F(ab) fragments used to treat venomous rattlesnake bites. The
composition was created from antibody molecules that include three fragments, F(ab)2,
F(ab) and F(c), which have separate properties and utilities. There had been
commercially available antivenom products that consisted of whole antibodies and F(ab)2
fragments, but researchers had not experimented with antivenoms containing only F(ab)
fragments because it was believed that their unique properties would prevent them from
decreasing the toxicity of snake venom. The inventor, Sullivan, discovered that F(ab)
fragments are effective at neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom, while
reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans. On appeal of the
examiner‚Äôs rejection, the Board held that the claim was obvious because all the elements
of the claimed composition were accounted for in the prior art, and that the composition
taught by that prior art would have been expected by a person of ordinary skill in the
art at the time the invention was made (the case was examined under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**) to neutralize the lethality of the venom of a rattlesnake.  
Rebuttal evidence had not been considered by the Board
because it considered the evidence to relate to the intended use of the claimed
composition as an antivenom, rather than the composition itself. Appellant successfully
argued that even if the Board had shown a *prima facie* case of
obviousness, the extensive rebuttal evidence must be considered. The evidence included
three expert declarations submitted to show that the prior art taught away from the
claimed invention, an unexpected property or result from the use of F(ab) fragment
antivenom, and why those having ordinary skill in the art expected antivenoms comprising
F(ab) fragments to fail. The declarations related to more than the use of the claimed
composition. While a statement of intended use may not render a known composition
patentable, the claimed composition was not known, and whether it would have been
obvious depends upon consideration of the rebuttal evidence. Appellant did not concede
that the only distinguishing factor of its composition is the statement of intended use
and extensively argued that its claimed composition exhibits the unexpected property of
neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom while reducing the occurrence of adverse
immune reactions in humans. The Federal Circuit found that such a use and unexpected
property cannot be ignored ‚Äì the unexpected property is relevant and thus the
declarations describing it should have been considered.  
Nonobviousness can be shown when a person of ordinary
skill in the art would not have reasonably predicted the claimed invention based on the
prior art, and the resulting invention would not have been expected. All evidence must
be considered when properly presented.  
**Example 3:**  
The case of *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure
Inc.,* 600 F.3d 1357, 94 USPQ2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2010), involved a disposable
protective covering for the portion of a hearing aid that is inserted into the ear
canal. The covering was such that it could be readily replaced by a user as needed.  
At the district court, Shure had argued that Hearing
Components‚Äô patents were obvious over one or more of three different combinations of
prior art references. The jury disagreed, and determined that the claims were
nonobvious. The district court upheld the jury verdict, stating that in view of the
conflicting evidence presented by the parties as to the teachings of the references,
motivation to combine, and secondary considerations, the nonobviousness verdict was
sufficiently grounded in the evidence.  
Shure appealed to the Federal Circuit, but the Federal
Circuit agreed with the district court that the jury‚Äôs nonobviousness verdict had been
supported by substantial evidence. Although Shure had argued before the jury that the
Carlisle reference taught an ear piece positioned inside the ear canal, Hearing
Components‚Äô credible witness countered that only the molded duct and not the ear piece
itself was taught by Carlisle as being inside the ear canal. On the issue of combining
references, Shure‚Äôs witness had given testimony described as ‚Äúrather sparse, and lacking
in specific details.‚Äù *Id.* at 1364, 94 USPQ2d at 1397. In
contradistinction, Hearing Components‚Äô witness ‚Äúdescribed particular reasons why one
skilled in the art would not have been motivated to combine the references.‚Äù *Id.* Finally, as to secondary considerations, the Federal Circuit
determined that Hearing Components had shown a nexus between the commercial success of
its product and the patent by providing evidence that ‚Äúthe licensing fee for a covered
product was more than cut in half immediately upon expiration‚Äù of the patent.  
Although the *Hearing Components* case
involves substantial evidence of nonobviousness in a jury verdict, it is nevertheless
instructive for Office personnel on the matter of weighing evidence. Office personnel
routinely must consider evidence in the form of prior art references, statements in the
specification, or declarations under **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** (for cases examined
under the **[AIA
35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**), **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** (for cases examined under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**), or **[1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** (for cases examined either
under the AIA or under pre-AIA law). Other forms of evidence may also be presented
during prosecution. Office personnel are reminded that evidence that has been presented
in a timely manner should not be ignored, but rather should be considered on the record.
However, not all evidence need be accorded the same weight. In determining the relative
weight to accord to rebuttal evidence, considerations such as whether a nexus exists
between the claimed invention and the proffered evidence, and whether the evidence is
commensurate in scope with the claimed invention, are appropriate. The mere presence of
some credible rebuttal evidence does not dictate that an obviousness rejection must
always be withdrawn. See **[MPEP ¬ß 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**. Office personnel must consider the appropriate
weight to be accorded to each piece of evidence. An obviousness rejection should be made
or maintained only if evidence of obviousness outweighs evidence of nonobviousness. See **[MPEP ¬ß
706](s706.html#d0e57969)**, subsection I. (‚ÄúThe standard to be applied in all cases
is the ‚Äòpreponderance of the evidence‚Äô test. In other words, an examiner should reject a
claim if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not
that the claim is unpatentable.‚Äù). **[MPEP ¬ß 716.01(d)](s716.html#d0e92769)** provides further
guidance on weighing evidence in making a determination of patentability.  
**Example 4:**  
*Yita LLC, v MacNeil IP LLC,* 69 F.4th
1356, 2023 USPQ2d 667 (Fed. Cir. 2023) involved consideration of Yita‚Äôs challenge to
MacNeil‚Äôs patent in two *inter partes* reviews (IPRs). In
IPR2020-01139, the Board found the patent claims nonobvious due to MacNeil‚Äôs ‚Äúevidence
of secondary considerations [which was] compelling and indicative of non-obviousness.‚Äù
On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board‚Äôs final written decision.  
MacNeil‚Äôs patent claims were directed to a vehicle floor
tray ‚Äúclosely conforming‚Äù to certain walls of the vehicle foot well, a feature that the
Board recognized was disclosed in one of the asserted prior art references (Rabbe). The
Board had found that MacNeil was entitled to a presumption of nexus because its marketed
vehicle trays embodied the claimed invention and were coextensive with the claims.  
On appeal, the Federal Circuit determined that the
finding of nexus rested on two legal errors: (1) the finding that Rabbe‚Äôs disclosure
needed to but did not establish that close conformance was well-known; and (2) the
misapplication of *WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co.,* 829 F.3d 1317, 119 USPQ2d
1301 (Fed. Cir. 2016), which did not speak to the present situation where the secondary
consideration evidence is linked to an individual element of the claimed invention,
specifically the close-conformity element taught by Rabbe.  
As to the first error, the court determined that their
previous case law made clear that ‚Äúobjective evidence of nonobviousness lacks a nexus if
it exclusively relates to a feature that was ‚Äòknown in the prior art‚Äô‚Äînot necessarily
well-known.‚Äù *Rambus Inc. v. Rea,* 731 F.3d 1248, 1257, 108 USPQ2d 1400
(Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in the original) (quoting *Ormco Corp. v. Align
Technology, Inc.,* 463 F.3d 1299, 1312, 79 USPQ2d 1931 (Fed. Cir. 2006))
(internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the court noted that the finding of
coextensiveness is only relevant to the presumption of nexus and it alone does not
decide the overall nexus question.  
As to the second error, the court determined the
secondary consideration evidence was related solely to the individual element of
close-conformance disclosed in the prior art to Rabbe. This circumstance was different
than the one present in *WBIP* in which no single feature (but only the
combination) was responsible for the secondary consideration evidence.  
The secondary consideration evidence was the only *Graham* factor that the Board deemed to weigh in favor of
nonobviousness. Because the Board determined that an artisan of ordinary skill would
have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to arrive at
the claimed invention with a reasonable expectation of success, the court reversed the
final written decision.

**I.** **ARGUMENT DOES NOT REPLACE EVIDENCE WHERE EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY**  
An argument by the applicant is not evidence unless it is an admission,
in which case, an examiner may use the admission in making a rejection. See **[MPEP ¬ß
2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)** and **[¬ß 2144.03](s2144.html#d0e210752)** for a discussion of
admissions as prior art.  
Arguments presented by applicant cannot take the place of evidence in
the record. See *In re De Blauwe,* 736 F.2d 699, 705, 222 USPQ 191, 196
(Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re* *Schulze,* 346 F.2d 600, 602, 145 USPQ 716, 718 (CCPA 1965); *In re Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 43 USPQ2d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (‚ÄúAn
assertion of what seems to follow from common experience is just attorney argument and
not the kind of factual evidence that is required to rebut a *prima
facie* case of obviousness.‚Äù). See **[MPEP ¬ß 716.01(c)](s716.html#d0e92659)** for examples of
applicant statements which are not evidence and which must be supported by an
appropriate affidavit or declaration.  
**II.** **ARGUING ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OR LATENT PROPERTIES**  
-
***Prima Facie Obviousness Is Not Rebutted by Merely Recognizing Additional
Advantages or Latent Properties Present But Not Recognized in the Prior
Art***  
Mere recognition of latent properties in the prior art does not
render nonobvious an otherwise known invention. *In re Wiseman,* 596
F.2d 1019, 201 USPQ 658 (CCPA 1979) (Claims were directed to grooved carbon disc
brakes wherein the grooves were provided to vent steam or vapor during a braking
action. A prior art reference taught noncarbon disc brakes which were grooved for the
purpose of cooling the faces of the braking members and eliminating dust. The court
held the prior art references when combined would overcome the problems of dust and
overheating solved by the prior art and would inherently overcome the steam or vapor
cause of the problem relied upon for patentability by applicants. Granting a patent
on the discovery of an unknown but inherent function (here venting steam or vapor)
‚Äúwould remove from the public that which is in the public domain by virtue of its
inclusion in, or obviousness from, the prior art.‚Äù 596 F.2d at 1022, 201 USPQ at
661.); *In re Baxter Travenol Labs.,* 952 F.2d 388, 21 USPQ2d 1281
(Fed. Cir. 1991) (Appellant argued that the presence of DEHP as the plasticizer in a
blood collection bag unexpectedly suppressed hemolysis and therefore rebutted any *prima facie* showing of obviousness. However, the closest prior
art utilizing a DEHP plasticized blood collection bag inherently achieved same
result, although this fact was unknown in the prior art.).  
‚ÄúThe fact that appellant has recognized another advantage which
would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior art cannot be the
basis for patentability when the differences would otherwise be obvious.‚Äù *Ex
parte Obiaya,* 227 USPQ 58, 60 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985) (The
prior art taught combustion fluid analyzers which used labyrinth heaters to maintain
the samples at a uniform temperature. Although appellant showed that an unexpectedly
shorter response time was obtained when a labyrinth heater was employed, the Board
held this advantage would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior
art.). See also  *Lantech Inc.**v. Kaufman Co. of Ohio Inc.,* 878 F.2d 1446, 12 USPQ2d 1076, 1077
(Fed. Cir. 1989), *cert. denied,* 493 U.S. 1058 (1990) (unpublished
‚Äî not citable as precedent) (‚ÄúThe recitation of an additional advantage associated
with doing what the prior art suggests does not lend patentability to an otherwise
unpatentable invention.‚Äù).  
*In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972) and *In re Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
discussed in **[MPEP
¬ß 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)** are also pertinent to this issue.

declaratory evidence alleging unexpected results.  
**III.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART DEVICES ARE NOT PHYSICALLY COMBINABLE**  
‚ÄúIt is well-established that a determination of obviousness based on
teachings from multiple references does not require an actual, physical substitution of
elements.‚Äù *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1332, 103 USPQ2d 1219, 1226
(Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing *In re Etter,* 756 F.2d 852, 859, 225 USPQ 1,
6 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (*en banc*)) (‚ÄúEtter's assertions that Azure cannot
be incorporated in Ambrosio are basically irrelevant, the criterion being not whether
the references could be physically combined but whether the claimed inventions are
rendered obvious by the teachings of the prior art as a whole.‚Äù). See also *In
re Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 425, 208 USPQ 871, 881 (CCPA 1981) (‚ÄúThe test for
obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily
incorporated into the structure of the primary reference.... Rather, the test is what
the combined teachings of those references would have suggested to those of ordinary
skill in the art.‚Äù); *In re Sneed,* 710 F.2d 1544, 1550, 218 USPQ 385,
389 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (‚Äú[I]t is not necessary that the inventions of the references be
physically combinable to render obvious the invention under review.‚Äù); and *In
re Nievelt,* 482 F.2d 965, 179 USPQ 224, 226 (CCPA 1973) (‚ÄúCombining the teachings of references does not involve an ability to combine
their specific structures.‚Äù).  
However, the claimed combination cannot change the principle of
operation of the primary reference or render the reference inoperable for its intended
purpose. See **[MPEP
¬ß 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI.  
**IV.** **ARGUING AGAINST REFERENCES INDIVIDUALLY**  
**One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the
rejections are based on combinations of references**. *In re
Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981); *In re Merck &
Co., Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Where a rejection
of a claim is based on two or more references, a reply that is limited to what a subset
of the applied references teaches or fails to teach, or that fails to address the
combined teaching of the applied references may be considered to be an argument that
attacks the reference(s) individually. Where an applicant‚Äôs reply establishes that each
of the applied references fails to teach a limitation and addresses the combined
teachings and/or suggestions of the applied prior art, the reply as a whole does not
attack the references individually as the phrase is used in *Keller* and reliance on *Keller* would not be appropriate. This is because
‚Äú[T]he test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the references would have
suggested to [a PHOSITA].‚Äù *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1333, 103
USPQ2d 1219, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  
**V.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF REFERENCES COMBINED**  
Reliance on a large number of references in a rejection does not,
without more, weigh against the obviousness of the claimed invention. *In re
Gorman,* 933 F.2d 982, 18 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Court affirmed a
rejection of a detailed claim to a candy sucker shaped like a thumb on a stick based on
thirteen prior art references.).  
**VI.** **ARGUING LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE NOT CLAIMED**  
Although the claims are interpreted in light of the specification,
limitations from the specification are not read into the claims. *In re Van
Geuns,* 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Claims to a
superconducting magnet which generates a ‚Äúuniform magnetic field‚Äù were not limited to
the degree of magnetic field uniformity required for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
imaging. Although the specification disclosed that the claimed magnet may be used in an
NMR apparatus, the claims were not so limited.); *Constant v. Advanced
Micro-Devices, Inc.,* 848 F.2d 1560, 1571-72, 7 USPQ2d 1057, 1064-1065 (Fed.
Cir.), *cert. denied,* 488 U.S. 892 (1988) (Various limitations on
which appellant relied were not stated in the claims; the specification did not provide
evidence indicating these limitations must be read into the claims to give meaning to
the disputed terms.); *Ex parte McCullough,* 7 USPQ2d 1889, 1891 (Bd.
Pat. App. & Inter. 1987) (Claimed electrode was rejected as obvious despite
assertions that electrode functions differently than would be expected when used in
nonaqueous battery since ‚Äúalthough the demonstrated results may be germane to the
patentability of a battery containing appellant‚Äôs electrode, they are not germane to the
patentability of the invention claimed on appeal.‚Äù).

relevant to claim interpretation.  
**VII.** **ARGUING ECONOMIC INFEASIBILITY**  
The fact that a "combination would not be made by businessmen for
economic reasons" does not mean that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not
make the combination because of some technological incompatibility. *In re
Farrenkopf,* 713 F.2d 714, 718, 219 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Prior art
reference taught that addition of inhibitors to radioimmunoassay is the most convenient,
but costliest solution to stability problem. The court held that the additional expense
associated with the addition of inhibitors would not discourage one of ordinary skill in
the art from seeking the convenience expected therefrom.).  
**VIII.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE AGE OF REFERENCES**  
‚ÄúThe mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness
of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge
of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.‚Äù *In re
Wright,* 569 F.2d 1124, 1127, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977) (100 year old
patent was properly relied upon in a rejection based on a combination of references.).
See also *Ex parte Meyer,* 6 USPQ2d 1966 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
1988) (length of time between the issuance of prior art patents relied upon (1920 and
1976) was not persuasive of nonobviousness).  
**IX.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART IS NONANALOGOUS**  
See **[MPEP
¬ß 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208985)** for case law pertaining to analogous art.  
**X.** **ARGUING IMPROPER RATIONALES FOR COMBINING REFERENCES**  
-
***A.***  ***Impermissible Hindsight***  
Applicants may argue that the examiner‚Äôs conclusion of obviousness
is based on improper hindsight reasoning. However, ‚Äú[a]ny judgment on obviousness is
in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based on hindsight reasoning, but so long as
it takes into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary skill in
the art at the time the claimed invention was made and does not include knowledge
gleaned only from applicant‚Äôs disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper.‚Äù *In re McLaughlin,* 443 F.2d 1392, 1395, 170 USPQ 209, 212 (CCPA
1971). ‚ÄúA factfinder should be aware, of course, of the distortion caused by
hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. . .
. Rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however,
are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.‚Äù *KSR Int'l
Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007)
(internal quotations omitted). Applicants may also argue that the combination of two
or more references is ‚Äúhindsight‚Äù because ‚Äúexpress‚Äù motivation to combine the
references is lacking. However, there is no requirement that an ‚Äúexpress, written
motivation to combine must appear in prior art references before a finding of
obviousness.‚Äù *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270, 1276, 69
USPQ2d 1686, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 402, 82
USPQ2d at 1389 (‚ÄúThe diversity of inventive pursuits and of modern technology
counsels against confining the obviousness analysis by a formalistic conception of
the words teaching, suggestion, and motivation, or by overemphasizing the importance
of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.‚Äù) See also *Uber Techs., Inc. v. X One, Inc.,* 957 F.3d 1334, 1339-40, 2020
USPQ2d 10476 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (‚Äú[W]e hold that the Board erred when it determined

individual.‚Äô This combination does not represent ‚Äòimpermissible hindsight‚Äô‚Ä¶. Rather,
because Okubo's terminal-side plotting and Konishi's server-side plotting were both
well known in the art, and were the only two identified, predictable solutions for
transmitting a map and plotting locations, it would have been obvious to substitute
server-side plotting for terminal-side plotting in a combination of Okubo and

***B.***  ***Obvious To Try Rationale***  
An applicant may argue the examiner is applying an improper ‚Äúobvious
to try‚Äù rationale in support of an obviousness rejection.  
An ‚Äúobvious to try‚Äù rationale may support a conclusion that a claim
would have been obvious where one skilled in the art is choosing from a finite number
of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success. ‚Äú [A]
person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or
her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely that
product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that
instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was
obvious under **[¬ß
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.‚Äù *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550
U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007).  
‚ÄúThe admonition that ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô is not the standard under **[¬ß
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** has been directed mainly at two kinds of error. In some
cases, what would have been ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô would have been to vary all parameters
or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at a successful
result, where the prior art gave either no indication of which parameters were
critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be
successful.... In others, what was ‚Äòobvious to try‚Äô was to explore a new technology
or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, where the
prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed
invention or how to achieve it.‚Äù *In re O‚ÄôFarrell,* 853 F.2d 894,
903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted) (The court held the
claimed method would have been obvious over the prior art relied upon because one
reference contained a detailed enabling methodology, a suggestion to modify the prior
art to produce the claimed invention, and evidence suggesting the modification would
be successful.).  
***C.***  ***Lack of Suggestion To Combine References***  
A teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine references that is
found in the prior art is an appropriate rationale for determining obviousness. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. However, it is just
one of a number of valid rationales for doing so. The Court in *KSR* identified several exemplary rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness which
are consistent with the proper ‚Äúfunctional approach‚Äù to the determination of
obviousness as laid down in *Graham.**KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415-21, 82 USPQ2d at 1395-97. See **[MPEP ¬ß
2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)** and **[¬ß 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**.  
***D.***  ***References Teach Away from the Invention or Render Prior Art
Unsatisfactory for Intended Purpose***  
In addition to the material below, see **[MPEP ¬ß 2141.02](s2141.html#d0e209106)** (prior art must be considered in its entirety, including disclosures that teach away
from the claims) and **[MPEP ¬ß 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI (proposed modification
cannot render the prior art unsatisfactory for its intended purpose or change the
principle of operation of a reference).  
**1.** **The Nature of the Teaching Is Highly
Relevant**  
A prior art reference that ‚Äúteaches away‚Äù from the claimed
invention is a significant factor to be considered in determining obviousness.
However, ‚Äúthe nature of the teaching is highly relevant and must be weighed in
substance. A known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply
because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the
same use.‚Äù *In re**Gurley,* 27 F.3d 551, 553, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994)
(Claims were directed to an epoxy resin based printed circuit material. A prior
art reference disclosed a polyester-imide resin based printed circuit material,
and taught that although epoxy resin based materials have acceptable stability and
some degree of flexibility, they are inferior to polyester-imide resin based
materials. The court held the claims would have been obvious over the prior art
because the reference taught epoxy resin based material was useful for the
inventor‚Äôs purpose, applicant did not distinguish the claimed epoxy from the prior
art epoxy, and applicant asserted no discovery beyond what was known to the
art.).  
Furthermore, ‚Äúthe prior art‚Äôs mere disclosure of more than one
alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives
because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the
solution claimed‚Ä¶.‚Äù *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73
USPQ2d 1141, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See also *UCB, Inc. v. Actavis Labs,
UT, Inc.,* 65 F.4th 679, 692, 2023 USPQ2d 448 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (‚Äúa
reference does not teach away if it merely expresses a general preference for an
alternative invention but does not criticize, discredit or otherwise discourage
investigation into the invention claimed.‚Äù) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting *DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,* 567 F.3d
1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009)); and *Schwendimann v. Neenah, Inc.,* 82 F.4th 1371, 1381, 2023 USPQ2d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (‚ÄúAlthough Oez [the prior
art] used a white pigment with a cross-linking polymer, it does not discourage a
skilled artisan from using the white pigment without a cross-linking polymer or
lead the skilled artisan in a direction divergent from the path taken in the
Appealed Patents. Thus, Oez's disclosure is substantial evidence that supports the
Board's finding that Oez does not teach away from the proposed combination.‚Äù).  
**2.** **References Cannot Be Combined Where Reference Teaches Away from Their
Combination**  
It is improper to combine references where the references teach
away from their combination. *In re Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731,
743, 218 USPQ 769, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (The claimed catalyst which contained both
iron and an alkali metal was not suggested by the combination of a reference which
taught the interchangeability of antimony and alkali metal with the same
beneficial result, combined with a reference expressly excluding antimony from,
and adding iron to, a catalyst.).  
**3.** **Proceeding Contrary to Accepted Wisdom Is Evidence of Nonobviousness**  
The totality of the prior art must be considered, and proceeding
contrary to accepted wisdom in the art is evidence of nonobviousness. *In
re Hedges,* 783 F.2d 1038, 228 USPQ 685 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Applicant‚Äôs
claimed process for sulfonating diphenyl sulfone at a temperature above 127¬∫C was
contrary to accepted wisdom because the prior art as a whole suggested using lower
temperatures for optimum results as evidenced by charring, decomposition, or
reduced yields at higher temperatures.).  
Furthermore, ‚Äú[k]nown disadvantages in old devices which would
naturally discourage search for new inventions may be taken into account in
determining obviousness.‚Äù *United States v. Adams,* 383 U.S. 39,
52, 148 USPQ 479, 484 (1966).  
***E.***  ***Applicability of KSR to All Technologies***  
At the time the *KSR* decision was
handed down, some observers questioned whether the principles discussed were intended
by the Supreme Court to apply to all fields of inventive endeavor. Arguments were
made that because the technology at issue in *KSR* involved the
relatively well-developed and predictable field of vehicle pedal assemblies, the
decision was relevant only to such fields. The Federal Circuit has soundly repudiated
such a notion, stating that *KSR* applies across technologies:
> This court also declines to cabin KSR to the
> ‚Äúpredictable arts‚Äù (as opposed to the ‚Äúunpredictable art‚Äù of biotechnology). In
> fact, this record shows that one of skill in this advanced art would find these
> claimed ‚Äúresults‚Äù profoundly ‚Äúpredictable.‚Äù  
*In re Kubin,* 561 F.3d 1351, 1360, 90 USPQ2d 1417, 1424 (Fed. Cir.
2009). Thus, Office personnel should not withdraw any rejection solely on the basis
that the invention lies in a technological area ordinarily considered to be
unpredictable. See also **[MPEP ¬ß 2143.02](s2143.html#d0e210414)**.  
**XI.** **FORM PARAGRAPHS**

¬ß 707.07(f)](s707.html#d0e74561)** for form paragraphs **[7.37](#fp7.37)** through **[7.38](#fp7.38)** which may be used where applicant‚Äôs
arguments are not persuasive or are moot.  
[[top]](#top) try rationale.)     eral Circuit pointed out
that in a proper obvious to try approach to obviousness, the possible options for
solving a problem must have been ‚Äúknown and finite.‚Äù *Id.* at
1339, 95 USPQ2d at 1107 (citing *Abbott,* 544 F.3d at 1351, 89
USPQ2d at 1171). In this case, nothing in the prior art would have suggested that
changing the sweep angle as Rolls-Royce had done would have addressed the issue of
endwall shock. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that changing the sweep angle
‚Äúwould not have presented itself as an option at all, let alone an option that
would have been obvious to try.‚Äù *Id.* The decision in *Rolls-Royce* is a reminder to Office personnel that the
obvious to try rationale can properly be used to support a conclusion of
obviousness only when the claimed solution would have been selected from a finite
number of potential solutions known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 9:**  
The case of *Perfect Web Tech., Inc. v.
InfoUSA, Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1328-29, 92 USPQ2d 1849, 1854 (Fed.
Cir. 2009), provides an example in which the Federal Circuit held that a claimed
method for managing bulk email distribution was obvious on the basis of an obvious
to try argument. In *Perfect Web,* the method required selecting
the intended recipients, transmitting the emails, determining how many of the
emails had been successfully received, and repeating the first three steps if a
pre-determined minimum number of intended recipients had not received the email.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs
determination on summary judgment that the claimed invention would have been
obvious. Failure to meet a desired quota of email recipients was a recognized
problem in the field of email marketing. The prior art had also recognized three
potential solutions: increasing the size of the initial recipient list; resending
emails to recipients who did not receive them on the first attempt; and selecting
a new recipient list and sending emails to them. The last option corresponded to
the fourth step of the invention as claimed.  
The Federal Circuit noted that based on ‚Äúsimple
logic,‚Äù selecting a new list of recipients was more likely to result in the
desired outcome than resending to those who had not received the email on the
first attempt. There had been no evidence of any unexpected result associated with
selecting a new recipient list, and no evidence that the method would not have had
a reasonable likelihood of success. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that, as
required by *KSR,* there were a ‚Äúfinite number of identified,
predictable solutions,‚Äù and that the obvious to try inquiry properly led to the
legal conclusion of obviousness.  
The Federal Circuit in *Perfect
Web* also discussed the role of common sense in the determination of
obviousness. The district court had cited *KSR* for the
proposition that ‚Äú[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary
creativity, not an automaton,‚Äù and found that ‚Äúthe final step [of the claimed
invention] is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim
‚Äòtry, try again.‚Äô‚Äù In affirming the district court, the Federal Circuit undertook
an extended discussion of common sense as it has been applied to the obviousness
inquiry, both before and since the *KSR* decision.  
The Federal Circuit pointed out that application of
common sense is not really an innovation in the law of obviousness when it stated,
‚ÄúCommon sense has long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness if
explained with sufficient reasoning.‚Äù *Perfect Web,* 587 F.3d at
1328, 92 USPQ2d at 1853 (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit then provided a
review of a number of precedential cases that inform the understanding of common
sense, including *In re Bozek,* 416 F.2d 1385, 1390, 163 USPQ
545, 549 (CCPA 1969) (explaining that a patent examiner may rely on ‚Äúcommon
knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any
specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference‚Äù) and *In re
Zurko,* 258 F.3d 1379, 1383, 1385, 59 USPQ2d 1693 at 1695, 1697 (Fed.
Cir. 2001) (clarifying that a factual foundation is needed in order for an
examiner to invoke ‚Äúgood common sense‚Äù in a case in which ‚Äúbasic knowledge and
common sense was not based on any evidence in the record‚Äù). The Federal Circuit
implicitly acknowledged in *Perfect Web* that the kind of strict
evidence-based teaching, suggestion, or motivation required in *In re
Lee,* 277 F.3d 1338, 1344, 61 USPQ2d 1430, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2002), is
not an absolute requirement for an obviousness rejection in light of the teachings
of *KSR.* The Federal Circuit explained that ‚Äú[a]t the time [of
the Lee decision], we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching,
suggestion, or motivation to combine references.‚Äù However, *Perfect
Web* went on to state that even under *Lee,* common
sense could properly be applied when analyzing evidence relevant to obviousness.
Citing *DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
1356, 80 USPQ2d 1641 (Fed. Cir. 2006), and *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d
977, 78 USPQ2d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006), two cases decided shortly before the Supreme
Court‚Äôs decision in *KSR,* the Federal Circuit noted that
although ‚Äúa reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations‚Äù is
required to use common sense, identification of a ‚Äúspecific hint or suggestion in
a particular reference‚Äù is not. See also *B/E Aerospace, Inc. v. C&D
Zodiac, Inc.,* 962 F.3d 1373, 1380-81, 2020 USPQ2d 10706 (Fed. Cir.
2020) (stating that ‚Äúthe Board‚Äôs invocation of common sense was properly
accompanied by reasoned analysis and evidentiary support‚Äù to show why it would be
obvious to incorporate a second recess to receive an airplane seat support). But
see *Arendi v. Apple,* 832 F.3d 1355, 119 USPQ2d 1822 (Fed. Cir.
2016) (finding that the Board had not provided a reasoned analysis, supported by
the evidence of record, for why ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù taught the missing process step).  
***F.******Known Work in One Field of Endeavor May Prompt Variations of It for Use
in Either the Same Field or a Different One Based on Design Incentives or Other
Market Forces if the Variations Are Predictable to One of Ordinary Skill in the
Art***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the scope and content of the prior art, whether
in the same field of endeavor as that of the applicant‚Äôs invention or a
different field of endeavor, included a similar or analogous device (method, or
product);
- (2) a finding that there were design incentives or market forces
which would have prompted adaptation of the known device (method, or product);
- (3) a finding that the differences between the claimed invention
and the prior art were encompassed in known variations or in a principle known
in the prior art;
- (4) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art, in view of
the identified design incentives or other market forces, could have implemented
the claimed variation of the prior art, and the claimed variation would have
been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art; and
- (5) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claimed invention
would have been obvious is that design incentives or other market forces could have
prompted one of ordinary skill in the art to vary the prior art in a predictable
manner to result in the claimed invention. If any of these findings cannot be made,
then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 1:**  
The fact pattern in *Dann v. Johnston,* 425 U.S.
219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) is set forth above in Example 1 in subsection D.  
The Court found that the problem addressed by applicant ‚Äì the
need to give more detailed breakdown by a category of transactions ‚Äì was closely
analogous to the task of keeping track of the transaction files of individual
business units. *Id.* at 229, 189 USPQ at 261. Thus, an artisan
in the data processing area would have recognized the similar class of problem and
the known solutions of the prior art and it would have been well within the
ordinary skill level to implement the system in the different environment. The
Court held that ‚Äú[t]he gap between the prior art and respondent‚Äôs system is simply
not so great as to render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the
art.‚Äù  *Id.* at 230, 189 USPQ at 261.  
**Example 2:**  
The claimed invention in *Leapfrog Enterprises, Inc. v.
Fisher-Price, Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 82 USPQ2d 1687 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
was directed to a learning device to help young children read phonetically. The
claim read as follows:  
An interactive learning device, comprising:  
a housing including a plurality of switches;  
a sound production device in communication with the switches and
including a processor and a memory;  
at least one depiction of a sequence of letters, each letter
being associable with a switch; and  
a reader configured to communicate the identity of the depiction
to the processor,  
wherein selection of a depicted letter activates an associated
switch to communicate with the processor, causing the sound production device to
generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter,
the sound being determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of
letter.  
The court concluded that the claimed invention would have been
obvious in view of the combination of two pieces of prior art, (1) Bevan (which
showed an electro-mechanical toy for phonetic learning), (2) the Super Speak &
Read device (SSR) (an electronic reading toy), and the knowledge of one of
ordinary skill in the art.  
The court made clear that there was no technological advance
beyond the skill shown in the SSR device. The court stated that ‚Äúone of ordinary
skill in the art of children‚Äôs learning toys would have found it obvious to
combine the Bevan device with the SSR to update it using modern electronic
components in order to gain the commonly understood benefits of such adaptation,
such as decreased size, increased reliability, simplified operation, and reduced
cost. While the SSR only permits generation of a sound corresponding to the first
letter of a word, it does so using electronic means. The combination is thus the
adaptation of an old idea or invention (Bevan) using newer technology that is
commonly available and understood in the art (the SSR).‚Äù  
The court found that the claimed invention was but a variation on
already known children‚Äôs toys. This variation presented no nonobvious advance over
other toys. The court made clear that there was no technological advance beyond
the skill shown in the SSR device. The court found that ‚Äú[a]ccommodating a prior
art mechanical device that accomplishes that goal to modern electronics would have
been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary skill in designing children‚Äôs learning
devices. Applying modern electronics to older mechanical devices has been
commonplace in recent years.‚Äù  
**Example 3:**  
The claimed invention in *KSR Int'l Co. v.
Teleflex**Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007), was an adjustable
pedal assembly with a fixed pivot point and an electronic pedal-position sensor
attached to the assembly support. The fixed pivot point meant that the pivot was
not changed as the pedal was adjusted. The placement of the sensor on the assembly
support kept the sensor fixed while the pedal was adjusted.  
Conventional gas pedals operated by a mechanical link which
adjusted the throttle based on the travel of the pedal from a set position. The
throttle controlled the combustion process and the available power generated by
the engine. Newer cars used computer controlled throttles in which a sensor
detected the motion of the pedal and sent signals to the engine to adjust the
throttle accordingly. At the time of the invention, the marketplace provided a
strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior
art taught a number of methods for doing so. The prior art (Asano) taught an
adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point with mechanical throttle control. The
prior art (‚Äò936 patent to Byler) taught an electronic pedal sensor which was
placed on a pivot point in the pedal assembly and that it was preferable to detect
the pedal‚Äôs position in the pedal mechanism rather than in the engine. The prior
art (Smith) taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer
from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the
pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedal‚Äôs footpad. The prior art (Rixon)
taught an adjustable pedal assembly (sensor in the footpad) with an electronic
sensor for throttle control. There was no prior art electronic throttle control
that was combined with a pedal assembly which kept the pivot point fixed when
adjusting the pedal.  
The Court stated that ‚Äú[t]he proper question to have asked was
whether a pedal designer of ordinary skill, facing the wide range of needs created
by developments in the field of endeavor, would have seen a benefit to upgrading
Asano with a sensor.‚Äù *Id.* at 424, 82 USPQ2d at 1399. The Court
found that technological developments in the automotive design would have prompted
a designer to upgrade Asano with an electronic sensor. The next question was where
to attach the sensor. Based on the prior art, a designer would have known to place
the sensor on a nonmoving part of the pedal structure and the most obvious
nonmoving point on the structure from which a sensor can easily detect the pedal‚Äôs
position was a pivot point. The Court concluded that it would have been obvious to
upgrade Asano‚Äôs fixed pivot point adjustable pedal by replacing the mechanical
assembly for throttle control with an electronic throttle control and to mount the
electronic sensor on the pedal support structure.  
**Example 4:**  
The claimed invention in *Ex parte Catan,* 83
USPQ2d 1569 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2007), was a consumer electronics device
using bioauthentication to authorize sub-users of an authorized credit account to
place orders over a communication network up to a pre-set maximum sub-credit
limit.  
The prior art (Nakano) disclosed a consumer electronics device
like the claimed invention, except that security was provided by a password
authentication device rather than a bioauthentication device. The prior art
(Harada) disclosed that the use of a bioauthentication device (fingerprint sensor)
on a consumer electronics device (remote control) to provide bioauthentication
information (fingerprint) was known in the prior art at the time of the invention.
The prior art (Dethloff) also disclosed that it was known in the art at the time
of the invention to substitute bioauthentication for PIN authentication to enable
a user to access credit via a consumer electronics device.  
The Board found that the prior art ‚Äúshows that one of ordinary
skill in the consumer electronic device art at the time of the invention would
have been familiar with using bioauthentication information interchangeably with
or in lieu of PINs to authenticate users.‚Äù The Board concluded that one of
ordinary skill in the art of consumer electronic devices would have found it
obvious to update the prior art password device with the modern bioauthentication
component and thereby gain, predictably, the commonly understood benefits of such
adaptation, that is, a secure and reliable authentication procedure.  
***G.******Some Teaching, Suggestion, or Motivation in the Prior Art That Would Have
Led One of Ordinary Skill To Modify the Prior Art Reference or To Combine Prior
Art Reference Teachings To Arrive at the Claimed Invention***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that there was some teaching, suggestion, or
motivation, either in the references themselves or in the knowledge generally
available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the reference or to
combine reference teachings;
- (2) a finding that there was reasonable expectation of success;
and
- (3) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that "a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated
to combine the prior art to achieve the claimed invention and whether there would
have been a reasonable expectation of success in doing so."  *DyStar
Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
1356, 1360, 80 USPQ2d 1641, 1645 (Fed. Cir. 2006). If any of these findings cannot be
made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
The courts have made clear that the teaching, suggestion, or
motivation test is flexible and an explicit suggestion to combine the prior art is
not necessary. The motivation to combine may be implicit and may be found in the
knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, or, in some cases, from the nature of
the problem to be solved. *Id.* at 1366, 80 USPQ2d at 1649. ‚Äú[A]n
implicit motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from
the prior art as a whole, but when the ‚Äòimprovement‚Äô is technology-independent and
the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable,
for example because it is stronger, cheaper, cleaner, faster, lighter, smaller, more
durable, or more efficient. Because the desire to enhance commercial opportunities by
improving a product or process is universal‚Äîand even common-sensical‚Äîwe have held
that there exists in these situations a motivation to combine prior art references
even absent any hint of suggestion in the references themselves. In such situations,
the proper question is whether the ordinary artisan possesses knowledge and skills
rendering him *capable* of combining the prior art references.‚Äù  *Id.* at 1368, 80 USPQ2d aPﬁ                                                    ∞–              Gﬁ     ∞±–  Gﬁ           Gﬁ     ∞±–  Gﬁ           Gﬁ     ∞±–  Gﬁ           Gﬁ     ∞±–  Gﬁ                 ∞±–  Gﬁ                 p¶–                     ∞¶–                      ∞¶–                      ∞¶–                      ∞¶–                     ∞¶–                     ¶–              V        , –  V             V        , –  V             V        , –  V             V        , –  V       2f_22805_16e)** et seq.

of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. In *Ball Aerosol v. Ltd.
Brands,* 555 F.3d 984, 89 USPQ2d 1870 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Federal Circuit
offered additional instruction as to the need for an explicit analysis. The Federal Circuit
explained that the Supreme Court‚Äôs requirement for an explicit analysis does not require
record evidence of an explicit teaching of a motivation to combine in the prior art.  
‚Äú[T]he analysis that ‚Äúshould be made explicit‚Äù refers not
to the teachings in the prior art of a motivation to combine, but to the court‚Äôs analysis.
. . . Under the flexible inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court, the district court
therefore erred by failing to take account of ‚Äòthe inferences and creative steps,‚Äô or even
routine steps, that an inventor would employ and by failing to find a motivation to combine
related pieces from the prior art.‚Äù *Ball Aerosol,* 555 F.3d at 993, 89
USPQ2d at 1877.  
The Federal Circuit‚Äôs directive in *Ball
Aerosol* was addressed to a lower court, but it applies to Office personnel as
well. When setting forth a rejection, Office personnel are to continue to make appropriate
findings of fact as explained in **[MPEP ¬ß 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)** and **[¬ß 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, and must provide
a reasoned explanation as to why the invention as claimed would have been obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art at the relevant time. This requirement for explanation
remains even in situations in which Office personnel may properly rely on common sense or
ordinary ingenuity. *In re Van Os,* 844 F.3d 1359, 1361, 121 USPQ2d 1209,
1211 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (‚ÄúAbsent some articulated rationale, a finding that a combination of
prior art would have been ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô or ‚Äòintuitive‚Äô is no different than merely stating
the combination ‚Äòwould have been obvious.‚Äô‚Äù).  
**I.** **EXAMPLES OF RATIONALES**  
Examples of rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness
include:  
- (A) Combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield
predictable results;
- (B) Simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain
predictable results;
- (C) Use of known technique to improve similar devices (methods, or
products) in the same way;
- (D) Applying a known technique to a known device (method, or product)
ready for improvement to yield predictable results;
- (E) ‚ÄúObvious to try‚Äù ‚Äì choosing from a finite number of identified,
predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success;
- (F) Known work in one field of endeavor may prompt variations of it
for use in either the same field or a different one based on design incentives or
other market forces if the variations are predictable to one of ordinary skill in
the art;
- (G) Some teaching, suggestion, or motivation in the prior art that
would have led one of ordinary skill to modify the prior art reference or to
combine prior art reference teachings to arrive at the claimed invention.  
Note that the list of rationales provided is not intended to be an
all-inclusive list. Other rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness may be
relied upon by Office personnel. Any rationale employed must provide a link between the
factual findings and the legal conclusion of obviousness.  
It is important for Office personnel to recognize that
when they do choose to formulate an obviousness rejection using one of the rationales
suggested by the Supreme Court in *KSR* and discussed herein, they are
to adhere to the guidance provided regarding the necessary factual findings. It remains
Office policy that appropriate factual findings are required in order to apply the
enumerated rationales properly.  
The subsections below include discussions of each rationale along with
examples illustrating how the cited rationales may be used to support a finding of
obviousness. Some examples use the facts of pre-*KSR* cases to show how
the rationales suggested by the Court in *KSR* may be used to support a
finding of obviousness. The cases cited (from which the facts were derived) may not
necessarily stand for the proposition that the particular rationale is the basis for the
court‚Äôs holding of obviousness, but they do illustrate consistency of past decisions
with the lines of reasoning laid out in *KSR.* Other examples are
post-*KSR* decisions that show how the Federal Circuit has applied
the principles of *KSR.* Cases are included that illustrate findings of
obviousness as well as nonobviousness. Note that, in some instances, a single case is
used in different subsections to illustrate the use of more than one rationale to
support a finding of obviousness. It will often be the case that, once the *Graham* inquiries have been satisfactorily resolved, a conclusion
of obviousness may be supported by more than one line of reasoning.  
***A.******Combining Prior Art Elements According to Known Methods To Yield
Predictable Results***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the prior art included each element claimed,
although not necessarily in a single prior art reference, with the only
difference between the claimed invention and the prior art being the lack of
actual combination of the elements in a single prior art reference;
- (2) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
combined the elements as claimed by known methods, and that in combination,
each element merely performs the same function as it does separately;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
recognized that the results of the combination were predictable; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that all the claimed elements were known in the prior art and one
skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by known methods with
no change in their respective functions, and the combination yielded nothing more
than predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395; *B/E Aerospace, Inc. v. C&D Zodiac,
Inc.,* 962 F.3d 1373, 1379, 2020 USPQ2d 10706 (Fed. Cir. 2020); *Sakraida v. AG Pro, Inc.,* 425 U.S. 273, 282, 189 USPQ 449, 453
(1976); *Anderson‚Äôs-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co.,* 396
U.S. 57, 62-63, 163 USPQ 673, 675 (1969); *Great Atl. & P. Tea Co. v.
Supermarket Equip. Corp.,* 340 U.S. 147, 152, 87 USPQ 303, 306 (1950).
‚Äú[I]t can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of
ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed
new invention does.‚Äù *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. If
any of these findings cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a
conclusion that the claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
art.  
**Example 1:**  
The claimed invention in *Anderson‚Äôs-Black Rock, Inc. v.
Pavement Salvage Co.,* 396 U.S. 57, 163 USPQ 673 (1969) was a paving
machine which combined several well-known elements onto a single chassis. Standard
prior art paving machines typically combined equipment for spreading and shaping
asphalt onto a single chassis. The patent claim included the well-known element of
a radiant-heat burner attached to the side of the paver for the purpose of
preventing cold joints during continuous strip paving. The prior art used radiant
heat for softening the asphalt to make patches, but did not use radiant heat
burners to achieve continuous strip paving. All of the component parts were known
in the prior art. The only difference was the combination of the ‚Äúold elements‚Äù
into a single device by mounting them on a single chassis. The Court found that
the operation of the heater was in no way dependent on the operation of the other
equipment, and that a separate heater could also be used in conjunction with a
standard paving machine to achieve the same results. The Court concluded that
‚Äú[t]he convenience of putting the burner together with the other elements in one
machine, though perhaps a matter of great convenience, did not produce a ‚Äònew‚Äô or
‚Äòdifferent function‚Äô‚Äù and that to those skilled in the art the use of the old
elements in combination would have been obvious. *Id.* at 60, 163
USPQ at 674.  
Note that combining known prior art elements is not sufficient to
render the claimed invention obvious if the results would not have been
predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art.  *United States v.
Adams,* 383 U.S. 39, 51-52, 148 USPQ 479, 483-84 (1966). In *Adams,* the claimed invention was to a battery with one
magnesium electrode and one cuprous chloride electrode that could be stored dry
and activated by the addition of plain water or salt water. Although magnesium and
cuprous chloride were individually known battery components, the Court concluded
that the claimed battery was nonobvious. The Court stated that ‚Äú[d]espite the fact
that each of the elements of the Adams battery was well known in the prior art, to
combine them as did Adams required that a person reasonably skilled in the prior
art must ignore‚Äù the teaching away of the prior art that such batteries were
impractical and that water-activated batteries were successful only when combined
with electrolytes detrimental to the use of magnesium electrodes. *Id.* at 42-43, 50-52, 148 USPQ at 480, 483. ‚Äú[W]hen the prior
art teaches away from combining certain known elements, discovery of successful
means of combining them is more likely to be nonobvious.‚Äù*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395.  
**Example 2:**  
The claimed invention in *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance
Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) was directed to a
system which employs a screw anchor for underpinning
existing foundations and a metal bracket to transfer the
building load onto the screw anchor. The prior art (Fuller) used screw anchors for
underpinning existing structural foundations. Fuller used a concrete haunch to
transfer the load of the foundation to the screw anchor. The prior art (Gregory)
used a push pier for underpinning existing structural foundations. Gregory taught
a method of transferring load using a bracket, wherein a metal bracket transfers
the foundation load to the push pier. The pier is driven into the ground to
support the load. Neither reference showed the two elements of the claimed
invention ‚Äì screw anchor and metal bracket ‚Äì used together. The court found that
‚Äúartisans knew that a foundation underpinning system requires a means of
connecting the foundation to the load-bearing member.‚Äù *Id.* at
1276, 69 USPQ2d at 1691.  
The nature of the problem to be solved ‚Äì underpinning unstable
foundations ‚Äì as well as the need to connect the member to the foundation to
accomplish this goal, would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to choose an
appropriate load bearing member and a compatible attachment. Therefore, it would
have been obvious to use a metal bracket (as shown in Gregory) in combination with
the screw anchor (as shown in Fuller) to underpin unstable foundations.  
**Example 3:**  
The case of *In re Omeprazole Patent
Litigation,* 536 F.3d 1361, 87 USPQ2d 1865 (Fed. Cir. 2008), is one in
which the claims in question were found to be nonobvious in the context of an
argument to combine prior art elements. The invention involved applying enteric
coatings to a drug in pill form for the purpose of ensuring that the drug did not
disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action. The drug at issue was
omeprazole, the generic name for gastric acid inhibitor marketed as
Prilosec¬Æ. The claimed formulation included two
layers of coatings over the active ingredient.  
The district court found that Astra‚Äôs patent in
suit was infringed by defendants Apotex and Impax. The district court rejected
Apotex‚Äôs defense that the patents were invalid for obviousness. Apotex had argued
that the claimed invention was obvious because coated omeprazole tablets were
known from a prior art reference, and because secondary subcoatings in
pharmaceutical preparations generally were also known. There was no evidence of
unpredictability associated with applying two different enteric coatings to
omeprazole. However, Astra‚Äôs reason for applying an intervening subcoating between
the prior art coating and omeprazole had been that the prior art coating was
actually interacting with omeprazole, thereby contributing to undesirable
degradation of the active ingredient. This degradation of omeprazole by
interaction with the prior art coating had not been recognized in the prior art.
Therefore, the district court reasoned that based on the evidence available, a
person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to include a
subcoating in an omeprazole pill formulation.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs
decision that the claimed invention was not obvious. Even though subcoatings for
enteric drug formulation were known, and there was no evidence of undue technical
hurdles or lack of a reasonable expectation of success, the formulation was
nevertheless not obvious because the flaws in the prior art formulation that had
prompted the modification had not been recognized. Thus there would have been no
reason to modify the initial formulation, even though the modification could have
been done. Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art likely would have
chosen a different modification even if they had recognized the problem.  
Office personnel should note that in this case the
modification of the prior art that had been presented as an argument for
obviousness was an extra process step that added an additional component to a
known, successfully marketed formulation. The proposed modification thus amounted
to extra work and greater expense for no apparent reason. This is not the same as
combining known prior art elements A and B when each would have been expected to
contribute its own known properties to the final product. In the *Omeprazole* case, in view of the expectations of those of
ordinary skill in the art, adding the subcoating would not have been expected to
confer any particular desirable property on the final product. Rather, the final
product obtained according to the proposed modifications would merely have been
expected to have the same functional properties as the prior art product.  
The *Omeprazole* case can also be
analyzed in view of the discovery of a previously unknown problem by the patentee.
If the adverse interaction between active agent and coating had been known, it
might well have been obvious to use a subcoating. However, since the problem had
not been previously known, there would have been no reason to incur additional
time and expense to add another layer, even though the addition would have been
technologically possible. This is true because the prior art of record failed to
mention any stability problem, despite the acknowledgment during testimony at
trial that there was a known theoretical reason that omeprazole might be subject
to degradation in the presence of the known coating material.  
**Example 4:**  
The case of *Crocs, Inc. v. U.S. Int'l
Trade Comm'n,* 598 F.3d 1294, 93 USPQ 1777 (Fed. Cir. 2010), is a
decision in which the claimed foam footwear was held by the Federal Circuit to be
nonobvious over a combination of prior art references.  
The claims involved in the obviousness issue were
from Crocs‚Äô U.S. Patent No. 6,993,858, and were drawn to footwear in which a
one-piece molded foam base section formed the top of the shoe (the upper) and the
sole. A strap also made of foam was attached to the foot opening of the upper,
such that the strap could provide support to the Achilles portion of the wearer‚Äôs
foot. The strap was attached via connectors that allowed it to be in contact with
the base section, and to pivot relative to the base section. Because both the base
portion and the strap were made of foam, friction between the strap and the base
section allowed the strap to maintain its position after pivoting. In other words,
the foam strap did not fall under the force of gravity to a position adjacent to
the heel of the base section.  
The International Trade Commission (ITC) determined
that the claims were obvious over the combination of two pieces of prior art. The
first was the Aqua Clog, which was a shoe that corresponded to the base section of
the footwear of the ‚Äò858 patent. The second was the Aguerre patent, which taught
heel straps made of elastic or another flexible material. In the ITC‚Äôs view, the
claimed invention was obvious because the prior art Aqua Clog differed from the
claimed invention only as to the presence of the strap, and a suitable strap was
taught by Aguerre.  
The Federal Circuit disagreed. The Federal Circuit
stated that the prior art did not teach foam heel straps, or that a foam heel
strap should be placed in contact with a foam base. The Federal Circuit pointed
out that the prior art actually counseled against using foam as a material for the
heel strap of a shoe.
> The record shows that the prior art would
> actually discourage and teach away from the use of foam straps. An ordinary
> artisan in this field would not add a foam strap to the foam Aqua Clog because
> foam was likely to stretch and deform, in addition to causing discomfort for a
> wearer. The prior art depicts foam as unsuitable for straps.  
*Id.* at 1309, 93 USPQ2d at 1787-88.  
The Federal Circuit continued, stating that even if
‚Äì contrary to fact ‚Äì the claimed invention had been a combination of elements that
were known in the prior art, the claims still would have been nonobvious. There
was testimony in the record that the loose fit of the heel strap made the shoe
more comfortable for the wearer than prior art shoes in which the heel strap was
constantly in contact with the wearer‚Äôs foot. In the claimed footwear, the foam
heel strap contacted the wearer‚Äôs foot only when needed to help reposition the
foot properly in the shoe, thus reducing wearer discomfort that could arise from
constant contact. This desirable feature was a result of the friction between the
base section and the strap that kept the strap in place behind the Achilles
portion of the wearer‚Äôs foot. The Federal Circuit pointed out that this
combination ‚Äúyielded more than predictable results.‚Äù *Id.* at
1310, 93 USPQ2d at 1788. Aguerre had taught that friction between the base section
and the strap was a problem rather than an advantage, and had suggested the use of
nylon washers to reduce friction. Thus the Federal Circuit stated that even if all
elements of the claimed invention had been taught by the prior art, the claims
would not have been obvious because the combination yielded more than predictable
results.  
The Federal Circuit‚Äôs discussion in Crocs serves as
a reminder to Office personnel that merely pointing to the presence of all claim
elements in the prior art is not a complete statement of a rejection for
obviousness. In accordance with **[MPEP ¬ß 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, subsection I.A.(3),
a proper rejection based on the rationale that the claimed invention is a
combination of prior art elements also includes a finding that results flowing
from the combination would have been predictable to a person of ordinary skill in
the art. **[MPEP ¬ß
2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, subsection I.A.(3). If results would not have been
predictable, Office personnel should not enter an obviousness rejection using the
combination of prior art elements rationale, and should withdraw such a rejection
if it has been made.  
**Example 5:**  
*Sundance, Inc. v. DeMonte Fabricating Ltd.,* 550 F.3d 1356, 89
USPQ2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 2008), involved a segmented and mechanized cover for
trucks, swimming pools, or other structures. The claim was found to be obvious
over the prior art applied.  
A first prior art reference taught that a reason
for making a segmented cover was ease of repair, in that a single damaged segment
could be readily removed and replaced when necessary. A second prior art reference
taught the advantages of a mechanized cover for ease of opening. The Federal
Circuit noted that the segmentation aspect of the first reference and the
mechanization function of the second perform in the same way after combination as
they had before. The Federal Circuit further observed that a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have expected that adding replaceable segments as taught by
the first reference to the mechanized cover of the other would result in a cover
that maintained the advantageous properties of both of the prior art covers.  
Thus, the Sundance case points out that a hallmark
of a proper obviousness rejection based on combining known prior art elements is
that one of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably have expected the elements
to maintain their respective properties or functions after they have been
combined.  
**Example 6:**  
In the case of *Ecolab, Inc. v. FMC
Corp.,* 569 F.3d 1335, 91 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2009), an ‚Äúapparent
reason to combine‚Äù in conjunction with the technical ability to optimize led to
the conclusion that the claimed invention would have been obvious.  
The invention in question was a method of treating
meat to reduce the incidence of pathogens, by spraying the meat with an
antibacterial solution under specified conditions. The parties did not dispute
that a single prior art reference had taught all of the elements of the claimed
invention, except for the pressure limitation of ‚Äúat least 50 psi.‚Äù  
FMC had argued at the district court that the
claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the first prior art reference
mentioned above in view of a second reference that had taught the advantages of
spray-treating at pressures of 20 to 150 psi when treating meat with a different
antibacterial agent. The district court did not find FMC‚Äôs argument to be
convincing, and denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law that the claim
was obvious.  
Disagreeing with the district court, the Federal
Circuit stated that ‚Äúthere was an apparent reason to combine these known elements
‚Äì namely to increase contact between the [antibacterial solution] and the bacteria
on the meat surface and to use the pressure to wash additional bacteria off the
meat surface.‚Äù *Id.* at 1350, 91 USPQ2d at 1234. The Federal
Circuit explained that because the second reference had taught ‚Äúusing high
pressure to improve the effectiveness of an antimicrobial solution when sprayed
onto meat, and because an ordinarily skilled artisan would have recognized the
reasons for applying [the claimed antibacterial solution] using high pressure and
would have known how to do so, Ecolab‚Äôs claims combining high pressure with other
limitations disclosed in FMC‚Äôs patent are invalid as obvious.‚Äù *Id.*  
When considering the question of obviousness,
Office personnel should keep in mind the capabilities of a person of ordinary
skill. In *Ecolab,* the Federal Circuit stated:
> Ecolab‚Äôs expert admitted that one skilled in the
> art would know how to adjust application parameters to determine the optimum
> parameters for a particular solution. The question then is whether it would
> have been obvious to combine the high pressure parameter disclosed in the
> Bender patent with the PAA methods disclosed in FMC‚Äôs ‚Äô676 patent. The answer
> is yes. *Id.*  
If optimization of the application parameters had
not been within the level of ordinary skill in the art, the outcome of the *Ecolab* case may well have been different.  
**Example 7:**  
In the case of *Wyers v. Master Lock
Co.,* 616 F.3d 1231, 95 USPQ2d 1525 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the Federal
Circuit held that the claimed barbell-shaped hitch pin locks used to secure
trailers to vehicles were obvious.  
The court discussed two different sets of claims in *Wyers,* both drawn to improvements over the prior art hitch
pin locks. The first improvement was a removable sleeve that could be placed over
the shank of the hitch pin lock so that the same lock could be used with towing
apertures of varying sizes. The second improvement was an external flat flange
seal adapted to protect the internal lock mechanism from contaminants. Wyers had
admitted that each of several prior art references taught every element of the
claimed inventions except for the removable sleeve and the external covering.
Master Lock had argued that these references, in combination with additional
references teaching the missing elements, would have rendered the claims obvious.
The court first addressed the question of whether the additional references relied
on by Master Lock were analogous prior art. As to the reference teaching the
sleeve improvement, the court concluded that it dealt specifically with using a
vehicle to tow a trailer, and was therefore in the same field of endeavor as
Wyers‚Äô sleeve improvement. The reference teaching the sealing improvement dealt
with a padlock rather than a lock for a tow hitch. The court noted that Wyers‚Äô
specification had characterized the claimed invention as being in the field of
locking devices, thus at least suggesting that the sealed padlock reference was in
the same field of endeavor. However, the court also observed that even if sealed
padlocks were not in the same field of endeavor, they were nevertheless reasonably
pertinent to the problem of avoiding contamination of a locking mechanism for tow
hitches. The court explained that the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in *KSR* ‚Äúdirects [it] to construe the scope of analogous art
broadly.‚Äù *Id.* at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530. For these reasons,
the court found that Master Lock‚Äôs asserted references were analogous prior art,
and therefore relevant to the obviousness inquiry.  
The court then turned to the question of whether
there would have been adequate motivation to combine the prior art elements as had
been urged by Master Lock. The court recalled the *Graham* inquiries, and also emphasized the ‚Äúexpansive and flexible‚Äù post-KSR approach to
obviousness that must not ‚Äúdeny factfinders recourse to common sense.‚Äù *Id.* at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530-31. (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415, 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1395, 1397). The
court stated:
> *KSR* and our later cases establish that the legal
> determination of obviousness may include recourse to logic, judgment, and
> common sense, in lieu of expert testimony. . . . Thus, in appropriate cases,
> the ultimate inference as to the existence of a motivation to combine
> references may boil down to a question of ‚Äúcommon sense,‚Äù appropriate for
> resolution on summary judgment or JMOL.  
*Id.* at 1240, 82 USPQ2d at 1531 (citing *Perfect Web
Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA, Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1330, 92 USPQ2d, 1849,
1854 (Fed. Cir. 2009); *Ball Aerosol,* 555 F.3d at 993, 89 USPQ2d
1870, 1875 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).  
After reviewing these principles, the court
proceeded to explain why adequate motivation to combine had been established in
this case. With regard to the sleeve improvement, it pointed out that the need for
different sizes of hitch pins was well known in the art, and that this was a known
source of inconvenience and expense for users. The court also mentioned the
marketplace aspect of the issue, noting that space on store shelves was at a
premium, and that removable sleeves addressed this economic concern. As to the
sealing improvement, the court pointed out that both internal and external seals
were well-known means to protect locks from contaminants. The court concluded that
the constituent elements were being employed in accordance with their recognized
functions, and would have predictably retained their respective functions when
combined as suggested by Master Lock. The court cited *In re
O‚ÄôFarrell,* 853 F.2d 894, 904 (Fed. Cir. 1988) for the proposition
that a reasonable expectation of success is a requirement for a proper
determination of obviousness.  
Office personnel should note that although the
Federal Circuit invoked the idea of common sense in support of a conclusion of
obviousness, it did not end its explanation there. Rather, the court explained why
a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, in view of the
facts relevant to the case, would have found the claimed inventions to have been
obvious. The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the
claimed invention would have been obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. The Court quoting *In
re Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006),
stated that ‚Äú[R]ejections on obviousness cannot be sustained by mere conclusory
statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational
underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.‚Äù See **[MPEP ¬ß
2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)**, subsection III. Office personnel should continue
to provide a reasoned explanation for every obviousness rejection.  
**Example 8:**  
The claim in *DePuy Spine, Inc. v.
Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,* 567 F.3d 1314, 90 USPQ2d 1865 (Fed.
Cir. 2009), was directed to a polyaxial pedicle screw used in spinal surgeries
that included a compression member for pressing a screw head against a receiver
member. A prior art reference (Puno) disclosed all of the elements of the claim
except for the compression member. Instead, the screw head in Puno was separated
from the receiver member to achieve a shock absorber effect, allowing some motion
between receiver member and the vertebrae. The missing compression member was
readily found in another prior art reference (Anderson), which disclosed an
external fracture immobilization splint for immobilizing long bones with a swivel
clamp capable of polyaxial movement until rigidly secured by a compression member.
It was asserted during trial that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized
that the addition of Anderson‚Äôs compression member to Puno‚Äôs device would have
achieved a rigidly locked polyaxial pedicle screw covered by the claim.  
In conducting its analysis, the Federal Circuit
noted that the ‚Äúpredictable result‚Äù discussed in *KSR* refers not
only to the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being physically
combined, but also that the combination would have worked for its intended
purpose. In this case, it was successfully argued that Puno ‚Äúteaches away‚Äù from a
rigid screw because Puno warned that rigidity increases the likelihood that the
screw will fail within the human body, rendering the device inoperative for its
intended purpose. In fact, the reference did not merely express a general
preference for pedicle screws having a ‚Äúshock absorber‚Äù effect, but rather
expressed concern for failure and stated that the shock absorber feature
‚Äúdecrease[s] the chance of failure of the screw of the bone-screw interface‚Äù
because ‚Äúit prevent[s] direct transfer of load from the rod to the bone-screw
interface.‚Äù Thus, the alleged reason to combine the prior art elements of Puno and
Anderson‚Äîincreasing the rigidity of the screw‚Äîran contrary to the prior art that
taught that increasing rigidity would result in a greater likelihood of failure.
In view of this teaching and the backdrop of collective teachings of the prior
art, the Federal Circuit determined that Puno teaches away from the proposed
combination such that a person of ordinary skill would have been deterred from
combining the references as proposed. Secondary considerations evaluated by the
Federal Circuit relating to failure by others and copying also supported the view
that the combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention.  
***B.******Simple Substitution of One Known Element for Another To Obtain
Predictable Results***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a device (method,
product, etc.) which differed from the claimed device by the substitution of
some components (step, element, etc.) with other components;
- (2) a finding that the substituted components and their functions
were known in the art;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
substituted one known element for another, and the results of the substitution
would have been predictable; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of
obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that the substitution of one known element for another yields
predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art. If any of these findings
cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the
claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 1:**  
The claimed invention in *In re Fout,* 675 F.2d
297, 213 USPQ 532 (CCPA 1982) was directed to a method for decaffeinating coffee
or tea. The prior art (Pagliaro) method produced a decaffeinated vegetable
material and trapped the caffeine in a fatty material (such as oil). The caffeine
was then removed from the fatty material by an aqueous extraction process.
Applicant (Fout) substituted an evaporative distillation step for the aqueous
extraction step. The prior art (Waterman) suspended coffee in oil and then
directly distilled the caffeine through the oil. The court found that ‚Äú[b]ecause
both Pagliaro and Waterman teach a method for separating caffeine from oil, it
would have been *prima facie* obvious to substitute one method
for the other. Express suggestion to substitute one equivalent for another need
not be present to render such substitution obvious.‚Äù *Id.* at
301, 213 USPQ at 536.  
**Example 2:**  
The claimed invention in *In re O‚ÄôFarrell,* 853
F.2d 894, 7 USPQ2d 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1988) was directed to a method for synthesizing
a protein in a transformed bacterial host species by substituting a heterologous
gene for a gene native to the host species. Generally speaking, protein synthesis *in vivo* follows a path from DNA to mRNA. Although the prior
art Polisky article (authored by two of the three joint inventors of the
application) had explicitly suggested employing the method described for protein
synthesis, the inserted heterologous gene exemplified in the article was one that
normally did not proceed all the way to the protein production step, but instead
terminated with the mRNA. A second reference to Bahl had described a general
method of inserting chemically synthesized DNA into a plasmid. Thus, it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to replace the prior art gene
with another gene known to lead to protein production, because one of ordinary
skill in the art would have been able to carry out such a substitution, and the
results were reasonably predictable.  
In response to applicant‚Äôs argument that there had been
significant unpredictability in the field of molecular biology at the time of the
invention, the court stated that the level of skill was quite high and that the
teachings of Polisky, even taken alone, contained detailed enabling methodology
and included the suggestion that the modification would be successful for
synthesis of proteins.  
This is not a situation where the rejection is a statement that
it would have been ‚Äúobvious to try‚Äù without more. Here there was a reasonable
expectation of success. ‚ÄúObviousness does not require absolute predictability of
success.‚Äù *Id.* at 903, 7 USPQ2d at 1681.  
**Example 3:**  
The fact pattern in *Ruiz v. AB Chance Co.,* 357
F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) is set forth above in Example 2 in
subsection I.A., above.  
The prior art showed differing load-bearing members and differing
means of attaching the foundation to the member. Therefore, it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to substitute the metal bracket taught
in Gregory for Fuller‚Äôs concrete haunch for the predictable result of transferring
the load.  
**Example 4:**  
The claimed invention in *Ex parte Smith,* 83
USPQ2d 1509 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2007), was a pocket insert for a bound book
made by gluing a base sheet and a pocket sheet of paper together to form a
continuous two-ply seam defining a closed pocket. The prior art (Wyant) disclosed
at least one pocket formed by folding a single sheet and securing the folder
portions along the inside margins using any convenient bonding method. The prior
art (Wyant) did not disclose bonding the sheets to form a continuous two-ply seam.
The prior art (Dick) disclosed a pocket that is made by stitching or otherwise
securing two sheets along three of its four edges to define a closed pocket with
an opening along its fourth edge.  
In considering the teachings of Wyant and Dick, the Board ‚Äúfound
that (1) each of the claimed elements is found within the scope and content of the
prior art; (2) one of ordinary skill in the art could have combined the elements
as claimed by methods known at the time the invention was made; and (3) one of
ordinary skill in the art would have recognized at the time the invention was made
that the capabilities or functions of the combination were predictable.‚Äù Citing *KSR,* the Board concluded that ‚Äú[t]he substitution of the
continuous, two-ply seam of Dick for the folded seam of Wyant thus is no more than
the simple substitution of one known element for another or the mere application
of a known technique to a piece of prior art ready for improvement.  
**Example 5:**  
The claimed invention in *In re ICON Health
& Fitness, Inc.,* 496 F.3d 1374, 83 USPQ2d 1746 (Fed. Cir. 2007),
was directed to a treadmill with a folding tread base that swivels into an upright
storage position, including a gas spring connected between the tread base and the
upright structure to assist in stably retaining the tread base in the storage
position. On reexamination, the examiner rejected the claims as obvious based on a
combination of references including an advertisement (Damark) for a folding
treadmill demonstrating all of the claim elements other than the gas spring, and a
patent (Teague) with a gas spring. Teague was directed to a bed that folds into a
cabinet using a novel dual-action spring that reverses force as the mechanism
passes a neutral position, rather than a single-action spring that would provide a
force pushing the bed closed at all times. The dual-action spring reduced the
force required to open the bed from the closed position, while reducing the force
required to lift the bed from the open position.  
The Federal Circuit addressed the propriety of
making the combination since Teague was in a different field than the application.
Teague was found to be reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed in the
application because the folding mechanism did not require any particular focus on
treadmills, but rather generally addressed problems of supporting the weight of
such a mechanism and providing a stable resting position.  
The court also considered whether one skilled in the
art would have been led to combine the teachings of Damark and Teague. Appellant
argued that Teague teaches away from the invention because it directs one skilled
in the art not to use single-action springs and does not satisfy the claim
limitations as the dual-action springs would render the invention inoperable. The
Federal Circuit considered these arguments and found that, while Teague at most
teaches away from using single-action springs to decrease the opening force, it
actually instructed that single-action springs provide the result desired by the
inventors, which was to increase the opening force provided by gravity. As to
inoperability, the claims were not limited to single-action springs and were so
broad as to encompass anything that assists in stably retaining the tread base,
which is the function that Teague accomplished. Additionally, the fact that the
counterweight mechanism from Teague used a large spring, which appellant argued
would overpower the treadmill mechanism, ignores the modifications that one
skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from the prior art. One skilled
in the art would size the components from Teague appropriately for the
application.  
*ICON* is another useful example for understanding the scope of
analogous art. The art applied concerned retaining mechanisms for folding beds,
not treadmills. When determining whether a reference may properly be applied to an
invention in a different field of endeavor, it is necessary to consider the
problem to be solved. It is certainly possible that a reference may be drawn in
such a way that its usefulness as a teaching is narrowly restricted. However,
in *ICON,* the problem to be solved was not limited to the
teaching of the ‚Äútreadmill‚Äù concept. The Teague reference was analogous art
because ‚ÄúTeague and the current application both address the need to stably retain
a folding mechanism,‚Äù and because ‚Äúnothing about ICON‚Äôs folding mechanism requires
any particular focus on treadmills,‚Äù *Id.* at 1378, 1380, 83
USPQ2d at 1749-50.  
*ICON* is also informative as to the relationship between the
problem to be solved and existence of a reason to combine. ‚ÄúIndeed, while perhaps
not dispositive of the issue, the finding that Teague, by addressing a similar
problem, provides analogous art to ICON‚Äôs application goes a long way towards
demonstrating a reason to combine the two references. Because ICON‚Äôs broad claims
read on embodiments addressing that problem as described by Teague, the prior art
here indicates a reason to incorporate its teachings.‚Äù *Id.* at
1380-81, 83 USPQ2d at 1751.  
The Federal Circuit‚Äôs discussion in *ICON* also makes clear that if the reference does not teach
that a combination is undesirable, then it cannot be said to teach away. An
assessment of whether a combination would render the device inoperable must not
‚Äúignore the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device
borrowed from the prior art.‚Äù *Id.* at 1382, 83 USPQ2d at
1752.  
**Example 6:**  
*Agrizap, Inc. v. Woodstream Corp.,* 520 F.3d 1337, 86 USPQ2d
1110 (Fed. Cir. 2008), involved a stationary pest control device for electrocution
of pests such as rats and gophers, in which the device is set in an area where the
pest is likely to encounter it. The only difference between the claimed device and
the prior art stationary pest control device was that the claimed device employed
a resistive electrical switch, while the prior art device used a mechanical
pressure switch. A resistive electrical switch was taught in two prior art
patents, in the contexts of a hand-held pest control device and a cattle prod.  
In determining that the claimed invention was
obvious, the Federal Circuit noted that ‚Äú[t]he asserted claims simply substitute a
resistive electrical switch for the mechanical pressure switch‚Äù employed in the
prior art device. *Id.* at 1344, 86 USPQ2d at 1115. In this case,
the prior art concerning the hand-held devices revealed that the function of the
substituted resistive electrical switch was well known and predictable, and that
it could be used in a pest control device. According to the Federal Circuit, the
references that taught the hand-held devices showed that ‚Äúthe use of an animal
body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an electric
charge was already well known in the prior art.‚Äù *Id.* Finally,
the Federal Circuit noted that the problem solved by using the resistive
electrical switch in the prior art hand-held devices ‚Äì malfunction of mechanical
switches due to dirt and dampness ‚Äì also pertained to the prior art stationary
pest control device.  
The Federal Circuit recognized *Agrizap* as ‚Äúa textbook case of when the asserted claims involve a
combination of familiar elements according to known methods that does no more than
yield predictable results.‚Äù *Id.**Agrizap* exemplifies a strong case of obviousness based on
simple substitution that was not overcome by the objective evidence of
nonobviousness offered. It also demonstrates that analogous art is not limited to
the field of the inventor‚Äôs endeavor, in that one of the references that used an
animal body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an
electric charge was not in the field of pest control.  
**Example 7:**  
The invention at issue in *Muniauction,
Inc. v. Thomson Corp.,* 532 F.3d 1318, 87 USPQ2d1350 (Fed. Cir. 2008),
was a method for auctioning municipal bonds over the Internet. A municipality
could offer a package of bond instruments of varying principal amounts and
maturity dates, and an interested buyer would then submit a bid comprising a price
and interest rate for each maturity date. It was also possible for the interested
buyer to bid on a portion of the offering. The claimed invention considered all of
the noted parameters to determine the best bid. It operated on conventional Web
browsers and allowed participants to monitor the course of the auction.  
The only difference between the prior art bidding
system and the claimed invention was the use of a conventional Web browser. At
trial, the district court had determined that Muniauction‚Äôs claims were not
obvious. Thomson argued that the claimed invention amounted to incorporating a Web
browser into a prior art auction system, and was therefore obvious in light of *KSR.* Muniauction rebutted the argument by offering evidence
of skepticism by experts, copying, praise, and commercial success. Although the
district court found the evidence to be persuasive of nonobviousness, the Federal
Circuit disagreed. It noted that a nexus between the claimed invention and the
proffered evidence was lacking because the evidence was not coextensive with the
claims at issue. For this reason, the Federal Circuit determined that
Muniauction‚Äôs evidence of secondary considerations was not entitled to substantial
weight.  
The Federal Circuit analogized this case to *Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price, Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157,
82 USPQ2d 1687 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The *Leapfrog* case involved a
determination of obviousness based on application of modern electronics to a prior
art mechanical children‚Äôs learning device. In *Leapfrog,* the
court noted that market pressures would have prompted a person of ordinary skill
to use modern electronics in the prior art device. Similarly in *Muniauction,* market pressures would have prompted a person
of ordinary skill to use a conventional Web browser in a method of auctioning
municipal bonds.  
**Example 8:**  
In *Aventis Pharma Deutschland v. Lupin
Ltd.,* 499 F.3d 1293, 84 USPQ2d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the claims were
drawn to the 5(S) stereoisomer of the blood pressure drug ramipril in
stereochemically pure form, and to compositions and methods requiring 5(S)
ramipril. The 5(S) stereoisomer is one in which all five stereocenters in the
ramipril molecule are in the S rather than the R configuration. A mixture of
various stereoisomers including 5(S) ramipril had been taught by the prior art.
The question before the court was whether the purified single stereoisomer would
have been obvious over the known mixture of stereoisomers.  
The record showed that the presence of multiple S
stereocenters in drugs similar to ramipril was known to be associated with
enhanced therapeutic efficacy. For example, when all of the stereocenters were in
the S form in the related drug enalapril (SSS enalapril) as compared with only two
stereocenters in the S form (SSR enalapril), the therapeutic potency was 700 times
as great. There was also evidence to indicate that conventional methods could be
used to separate the various stereoisomers of ramipril.  
The district court saw the issue as a close case,
because, in its view, there was no clear motivation in the prior art to isolate
5(S) ramipril. However, the Federal Circuit disagreed, and found that the claims
would have been obvious. The Federal Circuit cautioned that requiring such a
clearly stated motivation in the prior art to isolate 5(S) ramipril ran counter to
the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in KSR, and the court stated:
> Requiring an explicit teaching to purify the
> 5(S) stereoisomer from a mixture in which it is the active ingredient is
> precisely the sort of rigid application of the TSM test that was criticized in *KSR.*  
*Id.* at 1301, 84 USPQ2d at 1204. The *Aventis* court also relied on the settled principle that in chemical cases, structural
similarity can provide the necessary reason to modify prior art teachings. The
Federal Circuit also addressed the kind of teaching that would be sufficient in
the absence of an explicitly stated prior art-based motivation, explaining that an
expectation of similar properties in light of the prior art can be sufficient,
even without an explicit teaching that the compound will have a particular
utility.  
In the chemical arts, the cases involving so-called
‚Äúlead compounds‚Äù form an important subgroup of the obviousness cases that are
based on substitution. The Federal Circuit has had a number of opportunities since
the *KSR* decision to discuss the circumstances under which it
would have been obvious to modify a known compound to arrive at a claimed
compound. The following cases explore the selection of a lead compound, the need
to provide a reason for any proposed modification, and the predictability of the
result.  
**Example 9:**  
*Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy‚Äôs Labs., Ltd.,* 533 F.3d 1353, 87
USPQ2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 2008), concerns the pharmaceutical compound rabeprazole.
Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor for treating stomach ulcers and related
disorders. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs summary judgment of
nonobviousness, stating that no reason had been advanced to modify the prior art
compound in a way that would destroy an advantageous property.  
Co-defendant Teva based its obviousness argument on
the structural similarity between rabeprazole and lansoprazole. The compounds were
recognized as sharing a common core, and the Federal Circuit characterized
lansoprazole as a ‚Äúlead compound.‚Äù The prior art compound lansoprazole was useful
for the same indications as rabeprazole, and differed from rabeprazole only in
that lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy substituent at the 4-position of the
pyridine ring, while rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy substituent. The trifluoro
substituent of lansoprazole was known to be a beneficial feature because it
conferred lipophilicity to the compound. The ability of a person of ordinary skill
to carry out the modification to introduce the methoxypropoxy substituent, and the
predictability of the result were not addressed.  
Despite the significant similarity between the
structures, the Federal Circuit did not find any reason to modify the lead
compound. According to the Federal Circuit:
> Obviousness based on structural similarity thus
> can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of
> ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound (i.e. a
> lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound. . . . In
> keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry, the requisite
> motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be
> explicit in the art. Rather ‚Äúit is sufficient to show that the claimed and
> prior art compounds possess a ‚Äòsufficiently close relationship . . . to create
> an expectation,‚Äô in light of the totality of the prior art, that the new
> compound will have ‚Äòsimilar properties‚Äô to the old.‚Äù *Id.* at
> 1357, 87 USPQ2d at 1455. (citations omitted)  
The prior art taught that introducing a fluorinated
substituent was known to increase lipophilicity, so a skilled artisan would have
expected that replacing the trifluoroethoxy substituent with a methoxypropoxy
substituent would have reduced the lipophilicity of the compound. Thus, the prior
art created the expectation that rabeprazole would be less useful than
lansoprazole as a drug for treating stomach ulcers and related disorders because
the proposed modification would have destroyed an advantageous property of the
prior art compound. The compound was not obvious as argued by Teva because, upon
consideration of all of the facts of the case, a person of ordinary skill in the
art at the time of the invention would not have had a reason to modify
lansoprazole so as to form rabeprazole.  
Office personnel are cautioned that the term ‚Äúlead
compound‚Äù in a particular opinion can have a contextual meaning that may vary from
the way a pharmaceutical chemist might use the term. In the field of
pharmaceutical chemistry, the term ‚Äúlead compound‚Äù has been defined variously as
‚Äúa chemical compound that has pharmacological or biological activity and whose
chemical structure is used as a starting point for chemical modifications in order
to improve potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic parameters;‚Äù ‚Äú[a] compound
that exhibits pharmacological properties which suggest its development;‚Äù and ‚Äúa
potential drug being tested for safety and efficacy.‚Äù See, e.g.,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound, accessed January 13, 2010;
www.combichemistry.com/glossary_k.html, accessed January 13, 2010; and
www.buildingbiotechnology.com/glossary4.php, accessed January 13, 2010.  
The Federal Circuit in *Eisai* makes it clear that from the perspective of the law of obviousness, any known
compound might possibly serve as a lead compound: ‚ÄúObviousness based on structural
similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have
led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound
(i.e. a lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound.‚Äù *Eisai,* 533 F.3d at 1357, 87 USPQ2d at 1455. Thus, Office
personnel should recognize that a proper obviousness rejection of a claimed
compound that is useful as a drug might be made beginning with an inactive
compound, if, for example, the reasons for modifying a prior art compound to
arrive at the claimed compound have nothing to do with pharmaceutical activity.
The inactive compound would not be considered to be a lead compound by
pharmaceutical chemists, but could potentially be used as such when considering
obviousness. Office personnel might also base an obviousness rejection on a known
compound that pharmaceutical chemists would not select as a lead compound due to
expense, handling issues, or other business considerations. However, there must be
some reason for starting with that particular lead compound other than the mere
fact that the ‚Äúlead compound‚Äù exists. See *Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm.
USA, Inc.,* 566 F.3d 999, 1007, 91 USPQ2d 1018, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
(holding that there must be some reason ‚Äúto select and modify a known compound‚Äù); *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Mylan Labs, Inc.,* 520 F.3d
1358, 1364, 86 USPQ2d 1196, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  
**Example 10:**  
The claimed chemical compound was also found to be
nonobvious in *Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA,
Inc.,* 566 F.3d 989, 90 USPQ2d 1947 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The compound at
issue was risedronate ‚Äì the active ingredient of Procter & Gamble‚Äôs
osteoporosis drug Actonel¬Æ. Risedronate is an example
of a bisphosphonate, which is a class of compounds known to inhibit bone
resorption.  
When Procter & Gamble sued Teva for
infringement, Teva defended by arguing invalidity for obviousness over one of
Procter & Gamble‚Äôs earlier patents. The prior art patent did not teach
risedronate, but instead taught thirty-six other similar compounds including 2-pyr
EHDP that were potentially useful with regard to osteoporosis. Teva argued
obviousness on the basis of structural similarity to 2-pyr EHDP, which is a
positional isomer of risedronate.  
The district court found no reason to select 2-pyr
EHDP as a lead compound in light of the unpredictable nature of the art, and no
reason to modify it so as to obtain risedronate. In addition, there were
unexpected results as to potency and toxicity. Therefore the district court found
that Teva had not made a *prima facie* case, and even if it had,
it was rebutted by evidence of unexpected results.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs
decision. The Federal Circuit did not deem it necessary in this case to consider
the question of whether 2-pyr EHDP had been appropriately selected as a lead
compound. Rather, the Federal Circuit reasoned that, if 2-pyr EHDP is presumed to
be an appropriate lead compound, there must be both a reason to modify it so as to
make risedronate and a reasonable expectation of success. Here, there was no
evidence that the necessary modifications would have been routine, so there would
have been no reasonable expectation of success.  
*Procter & Gamble* is also informative in its discussion of
the treatment of secondary considerations of non-obviousness. Although the court
found that no *prima facie* case of obviousness had been
presented, it proceeded to analyze Procter & Gamble‚Äôs proffered evidence
countering the alleged *prima facie* case in some detail, thus
shedding light on the proper treatment of such evidence.  
The Federal Circuit noted in dicta that even if a *prima facie* case of obviousness had been established,
sufficient evidence of unexpected results was introduced to rebut such a showing.
At trial, the witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate
were not expected, offering evidence that researchers did not predict either the
potency or the low dose at which the compound was effective. Tests comparing
risedronate to a compound in the prior art reference showed that risedronate
outperformed the other compound by a substantial margin, could be administered in
a greater amount without an observable toxic effect, and was not lethal at the
same levels as the other compound. The weight of the evidence and the credibility
of the witnesses were sufficient to show unexpected results that would have
rebutted an obviousness determination. Thus, nonobviousness can be shown when a
claimed invention is shown to have unexpectedly superior properties when compared
to the prior art.  
The court then addressed the evidence of commercial
success of risedronate and the evidence that risedronate met a long felt need. The
court pointed out that little weight was to be afforded to the commercial success
because the competing product was also assigned to Procter & Gamble. However,
the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs conclusion that risedronate met
a long-felt, but unsatisfied need. The court rejected Teva‚Äôs contention that
because the competing drug was available before
Actonel¬Æ, there was no unmet need that the invention
satisfied. The court emphasized that whether there was a long-felt but unsatisfied
need is to be evaluated based on the circumstances as of the filing date of the
challenged invention ‚Äì not as of the date that the invention is brought to market.  
It should be noted that the lead compound cases do
not stand for the proposition that identification of a single lead compound is
necessary in every obviousness rejection of a chemical compound. For example, one
might envision a suggestion in the prior art to formulate a compound having
certain structurally defined moieties, or moieties with certain properties. If a
person of ordinary skill would have known how to synthesize such a compound, and
the structural and/or functional result could reasonably have been predicted, then
a *prima facie* case of obviousness of the claimed chemical
compound might exist even without identification of a particular lead compound. As
a second example, it could be possible to view a claimed compound as consisting of
two known compounds attached via a chemical linker. The claimed compound might
properly be found to have been obvious if there would have been a reason to link
the two, if one of ordinary skill would have known how to do so, and if the
resulting compound would have been the predictable result of the linkage
procedure. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that in certain situations, it
may be proper to reject a claimed chemical compound as obvious even without
identifying a single lead compound.  
**Example 11:**  
The decision reached by the Federal Circuit
in *Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc.,* 566 F.3d 999,
91 USPQ2d 1018 (Fed. Cir. 2009), as discussed below, involved a motion for
preliminary injunction and did not include a final determination of obviousness.
However, the case is instructive as to the issue of selecting a lead compound.  
The technology involved in *Altana* was the compound pantoprazole, which is the active
ingredient in Altana‚Äôs antiulcer drug Protonix¬Æ.
Pantoprazole belongs to a class of compounds known as proton pump inhibitors that
are used to treat gastric acid disorders in the stomach.  
Altana accused Teva of infringement. The district
court denied Altana‚Äôs motion for preliminary injunction for failure to establish a
likelihood of success on the merits, determining that Teva had demonstrated a
substantial question of invalidity for obviousness in light of one of Altana‚Äôs
prior patents. Altana‚Äôs patent discussed a compound referred to as compound 12,
which was one of eighteen compounds disclosed. The claimed compound pantoprazole
was structurally similar to compound 12. The district court found that one of
ordinary skill in the art would have selected compound 12 as a lead compound for
modification, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.  
Obviousness of a chemical compound in view of its
structural similarity to a prior art compound may be shown by identifying some
line of reasoning that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select
and modify the prior art compound in a particular way to produce the claimed
compound. The necessary line of reasoning can be drawn from any number of sources
and need not necessarily be explicitly found in the prior art of record. The
Federal Circuit determined that ample evidence supported the district court‚Äôs
finding that compound 12 was a natural choice for further development. For
example, Altana‚Äôs prior art patent claimed that its compounds, including compound
12, were improvements over the prior art; compound 12 was disclosed as one of the
more potent of the eighteen compounds disclosed; the patent examiner had
considered the compounds of Altana‚Äôs prior art patent to be relevant during the
prosecution of the patent in suit; and experts had opined that one of ordinary
skill in the art would have selected the eighteen compounds to pursue further
investigation into their potential as proton pump inhibitors.  
In response to Altana‚Äôs argument that the prior art
must point to only a single lead compound for further development, the Federal
Circuit stated that a ‚Äúrestrictive view of the lead compound test would present a
rigid test similar to the teaching-suggestion-motivation test that the Supreme
Court explicitly rejected in *KSR* . . . . The district court in
this case employed a flexible approach ‚Äì one that was admittedly preliminary ‚Äì and
found that the defendants had raised a substantial question that one of skill in
the art would have used the more potent compounds of [Altana‚Äôs prior art] patent,
including compound 12, as a starting point from which to pursue further
development efforts. That finding was not clearly erroneous.‚Äù *Id.* at 1008, 91 USPQ2d at 1025.  
***C.******Use of Known Technique To Improve Similar Devices (Methods, or Products)
in the Same Way***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a ‚Äúbase‚Äù device
(method, or product) upon which the claimed invention can be seen as an
‚Äúimprovement;‚Äù
- (2) a finding that the prior art contained a ‚Äúcomparable‚Äù device
(method, or product that is not the same as the base device) that has been
improved in the same way as the claimed invention;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
applied the known ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù technique in the same way to the ‚Äúbase‚Äù device
(method, or product) and the results would have been predictable to one of
ordinary skill in the art; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that a method of enhancing a particular class of devices (methods, or
products) has been made part of the ordinary capabilities of one skilled in the art
based upon the teaching of such improvement in other situations. One of ordinary
skill in the art would have been capable of applying this known method of enhancement
to a ‚Äúbase‚Äù device (method, or product) in the prior art and the results would have
been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. ‚ÄúIt's enough ‚Ä¶ to show that
there was a known problem ‚Ä¶ in the art, that [another reference] ‚Ä¶ helped address
that issue, and that combining the teachings of [the two references] wasn't beyond
the skill of an ordinary artisan. Nothing more is required to show a motivation to
combine under *KSR.*‚Äù See *Intel Corp. v. PACT XPP Schweiz
AG,* 61 F.4th 1373, 1380-81, 2023 USPQ2d 297 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (finding
that both prior art references ‚Äúaddress the same problem and that [the secondary
reference‚Äôs] cache was a known way to address that problem is precisely the reason
that there's a motivation to combine under *KSR* and our
precedent.‚Äù).  
The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted
that if the actual application of the technique would have been beyond the skill of
one of ordinary skill in the art, then using the technique would not have been
obvious. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 417, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. If any of these
findings cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion
that the claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 1:**  
The claimed invention in *In re Nilssen,* 851
F.2d 1401, 7 USPQ2d 1500 (Fed. Cir. 1988) was directed to a ‚Äúmeans by which the
self-oscillating inverter in a power-line-operated inverter-type fluorescent lamp
ballast is disabled in case the output current from the inverter exceeds some
pre-established threshold level for more than a very brief period.‚Äù *Id.* at 1402, 7 USPQ2d at 1501 That is, the current output
was monitored, and if the current output exceeded some threshold for a specified
short time, an actuation signal was sent and the inverter was disabled to protect
it from damage.  
The prior art (a USSR certificate) described a device for
protecting an inverter circuit in an undisclosed manner via a control means. The
device indicated the high-load condition by way of the control means, but did not
indicate the specific manner of overload protection. The prior art (Kammiller)
disclosed disabling the inverter in the event of a high-load current condition in
order to protect the inverter circuit. That is, the overload protection was
achieved by disabling the inverter by means of a cutoff switch.  
The court found ‚Äúit would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art to use the threshold signal produced in the USSR device to
actuate a cutoff switch to render the inverter inoperative as taught by
Kammiller.‚Äù *Id.* at 1403, 7 USPQ2d at 1502. That is, using the
known technique of a cutoff switch for protecting a circuit to provide the
protection desired in the inverter circuit of the USSR document would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill.  
**Example 2:**  
The fact pattern in *Ruiz v. AB Chance Co.,* 357
F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) is set forth above in Example 2 in
subsection I.A.  
The nature of the problem to be solved may lead inventors to look
at references relating to possible solutions to that problem. *Id.* at 1277, 69 USPQ2d at 1691. Therefore, it would have
been obvious to use a metal bracket (as shown in Gregory) with the screw anchor
(as shown in Fuller) to underpin unstable foundations.  
***D.******Applying a Known Technique to a Known Device (Method, or Product) Ready
for Improvement To Yield Predictable Results***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a ‚Äúbase‚Äù device
(method, or product) upon which the claimed invention can be seen as an
‚Äúimprovement;‚Äù
- (2) a finding that the prior art contained a known technique that
is applicable to the base device (method, or product);
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
recognized that applying the known technique would have yielded predictable
results and resulted in an improved system; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that a particular known technique was recognized as part of the
ordinary capabilities of one skilled in the art. One of ordinary skill in the art
would have been capable of applying this known technique to a known device (method,
or product) that was ready for improvement and the results would have been
predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. If any of these findings cannot be
made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 1:**  
The claimed invention in *Dann v. Johnston,* 425
U.S. 219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) was directed towards a system (i.e., computer) for
automatic record keeping of bank checks and deposits. In this system, a customer
would put a numerical category code on each check or deposit slip. The check
processing system would record these on the check in magnetic ink, just as it does
for amount and account information. With this system in place, the bank can
provide statements to customers that are broken down to give subtotals for each
category. The claimed system also allowed the bank to print reports according to a
style requested by the customer. As characterized by the Court, ‚Äú[u]nder
respondent‚Äôs invention, then, a general purpose computer is programmed to provide
bank customers with an individualized and categorized breakdown of their
transactions during the period in question.‚Äù *Id.* at 222, 189
USPQ at 259.  
BASE SYSTEM - The nature of the use of data processing equipment
and computer software in the banking industry was that banks routinely did much of
the record-keeping automatically. In routine check processing, the system read any
magnetic ink characters identifying the account and routing. The system also read
the amount of the check and then printed that value in a designated area of the
check. The check was then sent through a further data processing step which used
the magnetic ink information to generate the appropriate records for transactions
and for posting to the appropriate accounts. These systems included generating
periodic statements for each account, such as the monthly statement sent to
checking account customers.  
IMPROVED SYSTEM - The claimed invention supplemented this system
by recording a category code which could be used to track expenditures by
category. Again, the category code will be a number recorded on the check (or
deposit slip) which will be read, converted into a magnetic ink imprint, and then
processed in the data system to include the category code. This enabled reporting
of data by category as opposed to only allowing reporting by account number.  
KNOWN TECHNIQUE - This is an application of a technique from the
prior art ‚Äì the use of account numbers (generally used to track an individual's
total transactions) to solve the problem of how to track categories of
expenditures to more finely account for a budget. That is, account numbers
(identifying data capable of processing in the automatic data processing system)
were used to distinguish between different customers. Furthermore, banks have long
segregated debits attributable to service charges within any given separate
account and have rendered their customers subtotals for those charges. Previously,
one would have needed to set up separate accounts for each category and thus
receive separate reports. Supplementing the account information with additional
digits (the category codes) solved the problem by effectively creating a single
account that can be treated as distinct accounts for tracking and reporting
services. That is, the category code merely allowed what might previously have
been separate accounts to be handled as a single account, but with a number of
sub-accounts indicated in the report.  
The basic technique of putting indicia on data to enable standard
sorting, searching, and reporting yielded no more than the predictable outcome
which one of ordinary skill would have expected to achieve with this common tool
of the trade and was therefore an obvious expedient. The Court held that ‚Äú[t]he
gap between the prior art and respondent‚Äôs system is simply not so great as to
render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the art.‚Äù *Id.* at 230, 189 USPQ at 261.  
**Example 2:**  
The fact pattern in *In re Nilssen,* 851 F.2d
1401, 7 USPQ2d 1500 (Fed. Cir. 1988) is set forth above in Example 1 in subsection
C.  
The court found ‚Äúit would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art to use the threshold signal produced in the USSR device to
actuate a cutoff switch to render the inverter inoperative as taught by
Kammiller.‚Äù *Id.* at 1403, 7 USPQ2d at 1502. The known
technique of using a cutoff switch would have predictably resulted in protecting
the inverter circuit. Therefore, it would have been within the skill of the
ordinary artisan to use a cutoff switch in response to the actuation signal to
protect the inverter.  
**Example 3:**  
The claimed invention in *In re
Urbanski,* 809 F.3d 1237, 1244, 117 USPQ2d 1499, 1504 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
was directed to a method of enzymatic hydrolysis of soy fiber to reduce water
holding capacity, requiring reacting the soy fiber and enzyme in water for about
60-120 minutes. The claims were rejected over two references, wherein the primary
reference, Gross, taught using a reaction time of 5 to 72 hours and the secondary
reference, Wong, taught using a reaction time of 100 to 240 minutes, preferably
120 minutes. The applicant argued that modifying the primary reference in the
manner suggested by the secondary reference would forego the benefits taught by
the primary reference, thereby teaching away from the combination. The court found
there was sufficient motivation to combine because both references recognized
reaction time and degree of hydrolysis as result-effective variables, which can be
varied to have a predictable effect on the final product; and the primary
reference does not contain an express teaching away from the proposed
modification. ‚ÄúSubstantial evidence thus supports the Board‚Äôs finding that a
person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to modify the Gross process by
using a shorter reaction time, in order to obtain the favorable properties
disclosed in Wong.‚Äù  
***E.******‚ÄúObvious To Try‚Äù ‚Äì Choosing From a Finite Number of Identified,
Predictable Solutions, With a Reasonable Expectation of Success***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that at the relevant time, there had been a
recognized problem or need in the art, which may include a design need or
market pressure to solve a problem;
- (2) a finding that there had been a finite number of identified,
predictable potential solutions to the recognized need or problem;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
pursued the known potential solutions with a reasonable expectation of success;
and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that ‚Äúa person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known
options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success,
it is likely that product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common
sense. In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show
that it was obvious under **[¬ß 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.‚Äù*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. If any of these findings cannot be made, then
this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
The question of whether a claimed invention can be
shown to be obvious based on an ‚Äúobvious to try‚Äù line of reasoning has been explored
extensively by the Federal Circuit in several cases since the *KSR* decision. The case law in this area is developing quickly in the chemical arts,
although the rationale has been applied in other art areas as well.  
Some commentators on the *KSR* decision have expressed a concern that because inventive activities are always
carried out in the context of what has come before and not in a vacuum, few
inventions will survive scrutiny under an obvious to try standard. The cases decided
since KSR have proved this fear to have been unfounded. Courts appear to be applying
the KSR requirement for ‚Äúa finite number of identified predictable solutions‚Äù in a
manner that places particular emphasis on predictability and the reasonable
expectations of those of ordinary skill in the art.  
The Federal Circuit pointed out the challenging nature
of the task faced by the courts ‚Äì and likewise by Office personnel ‚Äì when considering
the viability of an obvious to try argument: ‚ÄúThe evaluation of the choices made by a
skilled scientist, when such choices lead to the desired result, is a challenge to
judicial understanding of how technical advance is achieved in the particular field
of science or technology.‚Äù *Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc.,* 544 F.3d
1341, 1352, 89 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Federal Circuit cautioned that
an obviousness inquiry based on an obvious to try rationale must always be undertaken
in the context of the subject matter in question, ‚Äúincluding the characteristics of
the science or technology, its state of advance, the nature of the known choices, the
specificity or generality of the prior art, and the predictability of results in the
area of interest.‚Äù *Id.*  
**Example 1:**  
The claimed invention in *Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex,
Inc.,* 480 F.3d 1348, 82 USPQ2d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2007), was directed to
the amlodipine besylate drug product, which was sold in tablet form in the United
States under the trademark Norvasc¬Æ. Amlodipine and the
use of besylate anions were both known at the time of the invention. Amlodipine
was known to have the same therapeutic properties as were being claimed for the
amlodipine besylate, but Pfizer discovered that the besylate form had better
manufacturing properties (e.g., reduced ‚Äústickiness‚Äù).  
Pfizer argued that the results of forming amlodipine besylate
would have been unpredictable and therefore nonobvious. The court rejected the
notion that unpredictability could be equated with nonobviousness here, because
there were only a finite number (53) of ***pharmaceutically acceptable*** salts to be tested for improved properties.  
The court found that one of ordinary skill in the art having
problems with the machinability of amlodipine would have looked to forming a salt
of the compound and would have been able to narrow the group of potential
salt-formers to a group of 53 anions known to form pharmaceutically acceptable
salts, which would be an acceptable number to form ‚Äúa reasonable expectation of
success.‚Äù  
**Example 2:**  
The claimed invention in *Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs.,
Inc.,* 464 F.3d 1286, 80 USPQ2d 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2006) was drawn to
sustained-release formulations of the drug oxybutynin in which the drug is
released at a specified rate over a 24-hour period. Oxybutynin was known to be
highly water-soluble, and the specification had pointed out that development of
sustained-release formulations of such drugs presented particular problems.  
A prior art patent to Morella had taught sustained-release
compositions of highly water-soluble drugs, as exemplified by a sustained-release
formulation of morphine. Morella had also identified oxybutynin as belonging to
the class of highly water-soluble drugs. The Baichwal prior art patent had taught
a sustained-release formulation of oxybutynin that had a different release rate
than the claimed invention. Finally, the Wong prior art patent had taught a
generally applicable method for delivery of drugs over a 24-hour period. Although
Wong mentioned applicability of the disclosed method to several categories of
drugs to which oxybutynin belonged, Wong did not specifically mention its
applicability to oxybutynin.  
The court found that because the absorption properties of
oxybutynin would have been reasonably predictable at the time of the invention,
there would have been a reasonable expectation of successful development of a
sustained-release formulation of oxybutynin as claimed. The prior art, as
evidenced by the specification, had recognized the obstacles to be overcome in
development of sustained-release formulations of highly water-soluble drugs, and
had suggested a finite number of ways to overcome these obstacles. The claims were
obvious because it would have been obvious to try the known methods for
formulating sustained-release compositions, with a reasonable expectation of
success. The court was not swayed by arguments of a lack of absolute
predictability.  
**Example 3:**  
The Federal Circuit‚Äôs decision in *In re
Kubin,* 561 F.3d 1351, 90 USPQ2d 1417 (Fed. Cir. 2009), affirmed the
Office‚Äôs determination in *Ex parte Kubin,* 83 USPQ2d 1410 (Bd.
Pat. App. & Int. 2007) that the claims in question, directed to an isolated
nucleic acid molecule, would have been obvious over the prior art applied. The
claim stated that the nucleic acid encoded a particular polypeptide. The encoded
polypeptide was identified in the claim by its partially specified sequence, and
by its ability to bind to a specified protein.  
A prior art patent to Valiante taught the polypeptide encoded by
the claimed nucleic acid, but did not disclose either the sequence of the
polypeptide, or the claimed isolated nucleic acid molecule. However, Valiante did
disclose that by employing conventional methods such as those disclosed by a prior
art laboratory manual by Sambrook, the sequence of the polypeptide could be
determined, and the nucleic acid molecule could be isolated. In view of Valiante‚Äôs
disclosure of the polypeptide, and of routine prior art methods for sequencing the
polypeptide and isolating the nucleic acid molecule, the Board found that a person
of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation that a
nucleic acid molecule within the claimed scope could have been successfully
obtained.  
Relying on *In re Deuel,* 51 F.3d 1552, 34
USPQ2d 1210 (Fed. Cir. 1995), appellant argued that it was improper for the Office
to use the polypeptide of the Valiante patent together with the methods described
in Sambrook to reject a claim drawn to a specific nucleic acid molecule without
providing a reference showing or suggesting a structurally similar nucleic acid
molecule. Citing *KSR,* the Board stated that ‚Äúwhen there is
motivation to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified,
predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the
known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to anticipated
success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and
common sense.‚Äù *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 402-03, 82 USPQ2d at 1390. The
Board noted that the problem facing those in the art was to isolate a specific
nucleic acid, and there were a limited number of methods available to do so. The
Board concluded that the skilled artisan would have had reason to try these
methods with the reasonable expectation that at least one would be successful.
Thus, isolating the specific nucleic acid molecule claimed was ‚Äúthe product not of
innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.‚Äù *Id.*  
The Board‚Äôs reasoning was substantially adopted by
the Federal Circuit. However, it is important to note that in the *Kubin* decision, the Federal Circuit held that ‚Äúthe Supreme
Court in *KSR* unambiguously discredited‚Äù the Federal Circuit‚Äôs
decision in *Deuel,* insofar as it ‚Äúimplies the obviousness
inquiry cannot consider that the combination of the claim‚Äôs constituent elements
was ‚Äòobvious to try.‚Äô‚Äù *Kubin,* 561 F.3d at 1358, 90 USPQ2d at
1422. Instead, *Kubin* stated that *KSR* ‚Äúresurrects‚Äù the Federal Circuit‚Äôs own wisdom in *O‚ÄôFarrell,* in
which ‚Äúto differentiate between proper and improper applications of ‚Äòobvious to
try,‚Äô‚Äù the Federal Circuit ‚Äúoutlined two classes of situations where ‚Äòobvious to
try‚Äô is erroneously equated with obviousness under **[¬ß 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.‚Äù *Kubin,* 561 F.3d at 1359, 90 USPQ2d at 1423. These two
classes of situations are: (1) when what would have been ‚Äúobvious to try‚Äù would
have been to vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until
one possibly arrived at a successful result, where the prior art gave either no
indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many
possible choices is likely to be successful; and (2) when what was ‚Äúobvious to
try‚Äù was to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a
promising field of experimentation, where the prior art gave only general guidance
as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it. *Id.* (citing *In re O‚ÄôFarrell,* 853 F.2d
894, 903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).  
**Example 4:**  
*Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd.,* 492 F.3d
1350, 83 USPQ2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2007), is an example of a chemical case in which
the Federal Circuit found that the claimed invention was not obvious. The claimed
compound was pioglitazone, a member of a class of drugs known as
thiazolidinediones (TZDs) marketed by Takeda as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.
The *Takeda* case brings together the concept of a ‚Äúlead
compound‚Äù and the obvious-to-try argument.  
Alphapharm had filed an Abbreviated New Drug
Application with the Food and Drug Administration, which was a technical act of
infringement of Takeda‚Äôs patent. When Takeda brought suit, Alphapharm‚Äôs defense
was that Takeda‚Äôs patent was invalid due to obviousness. Alphapharm argued that a
two-step modification ‚Äì involving homologation and ring-walking ‚Äì of a known
compound identified as ‚Äúcompound b‚Äù would have produced pioglitazone, and that it
was therefore obvious.  
The district court found that there would have been
no reason to select compound b as a lead compound. There were a large number of
similar prior art TZD compounds; fifty-four were specifically identified in
Takeda‚Äôs prior patent, and the district court observed that ‚Äúhundreds of millions‚Äù
were more generally disclosed. Although the parties agreed that compound b
represented the closest prior art, one reference taught certain disadvantageous
properties associated with compound b, which according to the district court would
have taught the skilled artisan not to select that compound as a lead compound.
The district court found no *prima facie* case of obviousness,
and stated that even if a *prima facie* case had been
established, it would have been overcome in this case in view of the unexpected
lack of toxicity of pioglitazone.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the
district court, citing the need for a reason to modify a prior art compound. The
Federal Circuit quoted *KSR,* stating:
> The *KSR* Court recognized that
> ‚Äú[w]hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there
> are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary
> skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical
> grasp.‚Äù *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. In such
> circumstances, ‚Äúthe fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that
> it was obvious under **[¬ß 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.‚Äù *Id.* That is not the case here. Rather than identify
> predictable solutions for antidiabetic treatment, the prior art disclosed a
> broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a
> lead compound for further investigation. Significantly, the closest prior art
> compound (compound b, the 6-methyl) exhibited negative properties that would
> have directed one of ordinary skill in the art away from that compound. Thus,
> this case fails to present the type of situation contemplated by the Court when

> The evidence showed that it was not obvious to try.  
*Takeda,* 492 F.3d at 1359, 83 USPQ2d at 1176.  
Accordingly, Office personnel should recognize that
the obvious to try rationale does not apply when the appropriate factual findings
cannot be made. In *Takeda,* there was a recognized need for
treatment of diabetes. However, there was no finite number of identified,
predictable solutions to the recognized need, and no reasonable expectation of
success. There were numerous known TZD compounds, and although one clearly
represented the closest prior art, its known disadvantages rendered it unsuitable
as a starting point for further research, and taught the skilled artisan away from
its use. Furthermore, even if there had been reason to select compound b, there
had been no reasonable expectation of success associated with the particular
modifications necessary to transform compound b into the claimed compound
pioglitazone. Thus, an obviousness rejection based on an obvious to try rationale
was not appropriate in this situation.  
**Example 5:**  
The case of *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v.
Mylan Labs, Inc.,* 520 F.3d 1358, 86 USPQ2d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 2008),
provides another example in which a chemical compound was determined not to be
obvious. The claimed subject matter was topiramate, which is used as an
anti-convulsant.  
In the course of working toward a new anti-diabetic
drug, Ortho-McNeil‚Äôs scientist had unexpectedly discovered that a reaction
intermediate had anti-convulsant properties. Mylan‚Äôs defense of invalidity due to
obviousness rested on an obvious to try argument. However, Mylan did not explain
why it would have been obvious to begin with an anti-diabetic drug precursor,
especially the specific one that led to topiramate, if one had been seeking an
anti-convulsant drug. The district court ruled on summary judgment that
Ortho-McNeil‚Äôs patent was not invalid for obviousness.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed. The Federal Circuit
pointed out that there was no apparent reason a person of ordinary skill would
have chosen the particular starting compound or the particular synthetic pathway
that led to topiramate as an intermediate. Furthermore, there would have been no
reason to test that intermediate for anticonvulsant properties if treating
diabetes had been the goal. The Federal Circuit recognized an element of
serendipity in this case, which runs counter to the requirement for
predictability. Summarizing their conclusion with regard to Mylan‚Äôs obvious to try
argument, the Federal Circuit stated:
> [T]his invention, contrary to Mylan‚Äôs
> characterization, does not present a finite (and small in the context of the
> art) number of options easily traversed to show obviousness. . . . *KSR* posits a situation with a finite, and in the context
> of the art, small or easily traversed, number of options that would convince an
> ordinarily skilled artisan of obviousness. . . . [T]his clearly is not the
> easily traversed, small and finite number of alternatives that *KSR* suggested might support an inference of obviousness. *Id.* at 1364, 86 USPQ2d at 1201.  
Thus, *Ortho-McNeil* helps to
clarify the Supreme Court‚Äôs requirement in KSR for ‚Äúa finite number‚Äù of
predictable solutions when an obvious to try rationale is applied: under the
Federal Circuit‚Äôs case law ‚Äúfinite‚Äù means ‚Äúsmall or easily traversed‚Äù in the
context of the art in question. As taught in *Abbott,* discussed
above, it is essential that the inquiry be placed in the context of the subject
matter at issue, and each case must be decided on its own facts.  
**Example 6:**  
In *Bayer Schering Pharma A.G. v. Barr
Labs., Inc.,* 575 F.3d 1341, 91 USPQ2d 1569 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the
claimed invention was an oral contraceptive containing micronized drospirenone
marketed as Yasmin¬Æ. The prior art compound
drospirenone was known to be a poorly water-soluble, acid-sensitive compound with
contraceptive effects. It was also known in the art that micronization improves
the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs.  
Based on the known acid sensitivity, Bayer had
studied how effectively an enteric-coated drospirenone tablet delivered a
formulation as compared to an intravenous injection of the same formulation to
measure the ‚Äúabsolute bioavailability‚Äù of the drug. Bayer added an unprotected
(normal) drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the
enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery. Bayer expected to find
that the enteric-coated tablet would produce a lower bioavailability than an
intravenous injection, while the normal pill would produce an even lower
bioavailability than the enteric-coated tablet. However, they found that despite
observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic
environment (supporting the belief that an enteric coating would be necessary to
preserve bioavailability), the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill resulted in
the same bioavailability. Following this study, Bayer developed micronized
drospirenone in a normal pill, the basis for the disputed patent.  
The district court found that a person having
ordinary skill in the art would have considered the prior art result that a
structurally related compound, spirorenone, though acid-sensitive, would
nevertheless absorb *in vivo,* would have suggested the same
result for drospirenone. It also found that while another reference taught that
drospirenone isomerizes *in vitro* when exposed to acid
simulating the human stomach, a person of ordinary skill would have been aware of
the study‚Äôs shortcomings, and would have verified the findings as suggested by a
treatise on the science of dosage form design, which would have then showed that
no enteric coating was necessary.  
The Federal Circuit held that the patent was invalid
because the claimed formulation was obvious. The Federal Circuit reasoned that the
prior art would have funneled the formulator toward two options. Thus, the
formulator would not have been required to try all possibilities in a field
unreduced by the prior art. The prior art was not vague in pointing toward a
general approach or area of exploration, but rather guided the formulator
precisely to the use of either a normal pill or an enteric-coated pill.  
It is important for Office personnel to recognize
that the mere existence of a large number of options does not in and of itself
lead to a conclusion of nonobviousness. Where the prior art teachings lead one of
ordinary skill in the art to a narrower set of options, then that reduced set is
the appropriate one to consider when determining obviousness using an obvious to
try rationale.  
**Example 7:**  
The case of *Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex,
Inc.,* 550 F.3d 1075, 89 USPQ2d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008), also sheds
light on the obvious to try line of reasoning. The claimed compound was
clopidogrel, which is the dextrorotatory isomer of methyl alpha-
5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlorophenyl)-acetate. Clopidogrel is
an anti-thrombotic compound used to treat or prevent heart attack or stroke. The
racemate, or mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory (D- and L-) isomers of the
compound, was known in the prior art. The two forms had not previously been
separated, and although the mixture was known to have anti-thrombotic properties,
the extent to which each of the individual isomers contributed to the observed
properties of the racemate was not known and was not predictable.  
The district court assumed that in the absence of
any additional information, the D-isomer would have been *prima
facie* obvious over the known racemate. However, in view of the
evidence of unpredicted therapeutic advantages of the D-isomer presented in the
case, the district court found that any *prima facie* case of
obviousness had been overcome. At trial, the experts for both parties testified
that persons of ordinary skill in the art could not have predicted the degree to
which the isomers would have exhibited different levels of therapeutic activity
and toxicity. Both parties‚Äô experts also agreed that the isomer with greater
therapeutic activity would most likely have had greater toxicity. Sanofi witnesses
testified that Sanofi‚Äôs own researchers had believed that the separation of the
isomers was unlikely to have been productive, and experts for both parties agreed
that it was difficult to separate isomers at the time of the invention.
Nevertheless, when Sanofi ultimately undertook the task of separating the isomers,
it found that they had the ‚Äúrare characteristic of ‚Äòabsolute stereoselectivity,‚Äô‚Äù
whereby the D-isomer provided all of the favorable therapeutic activity but no
significant toxicity, while the L-isomer produced no therapeutic activity but
virtually all of the toxicity. Based on this record, the district court concluded
that Apotex had not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that Sanofi‚Äôs patent was invalid for obviousness. The Federal Circuit affirmed the
district court‚Äôs conclusion.  
Office personnel should recognize that even when
only a small number of possible choices exist, the obvious to try line of
reasoning is not appropriate when, upon consideration of all of the evidence, the
outcome would not have been reasonably predictable and the inventor would not have
had a reasonable expectation of success. In *Bayer,* there were
art-based reasons to expect that both the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill
would be therapeutically suitable, even though not all prior art studies were in
complete agreement. Thus, the result obtained was not unexpected. In *Sanofi,* on the other hand, there was strong evidence that
persons of ordinary skill in the art, prior to the separation of the isomers,
would have had no reason to expect that the D-isomer would have such strong
therapeutic advantages as compared with the L-isomer. In other words, the result
in *Sanofi* was unexpected.  
**Example 8:**  
In *Rolls-Royce, PLC v. United Tech.
Corp.,* 603 F.3d 1325, 95 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the Federal
Circuit addressed the obvious to try rationale in the context of a fan blade for
jet engines. The case had arisen out of an interference proceeding. Finding that
the district court had correctly determined that there was no interference-in-fact
because Rolls-Royce‚Äôs claims would not have been obvious in light of United‚Äôs
application, the Federal Circuit affirmed.  
The Federal Circuit described the fan blade of the
count as follows:
> Each fan blade has three regions ‚Äì an inner, an
> intermediate, and an outer region. The area closest to the axis of rotation at
> the hub is the inner region. The area farthest from the center of the engine
> and closest to the casing surrounding the engine is the outer region. The
> intermediate region falls in between. The count defines a fan blade with a
> swept-forward inner region, a swept-rearward intermediate region, and
> forward-leaning outer region.  
*Id.* at 1328, 95 USPQ2d at 1099.  
United had argued that it would have been obvious
for a person of ordinary skill in the art to try a fan blade design in which the
sweep angle in the outer region was reversed as compared with prior art fan blades
from rearward to forward sweep, in order to reduce endwall shock. The Federal
Circuit disagreed with United‚Äôs assessment that the claimed fan blade would have
been obvious based on an obvious to try rationale. The Federal Circuit pointed out
that in a proper obvious to try approach to obviousness, the possible options for
solving a problem must have been ‚Äúknown and finite.‚Äù *Id.* at
1339, 95 USPQ2d at 1107 (citing *Abbott,* 544 F.3d at 1351, 89
USPQ2d at 1171). In this case, nothing in the prior art would have suggested that
changing the sweep angle as Rolls-Royce had done would have addressed the issue of
endwall shock. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that changing the sweep angle
‚Äúwould not have presented itself as an option at all, let alone an option that
would have been obvious to try.‚Äù *Id.* The decision in *Rolls-Royce* is a reminder to Office personnel that the
obvious to try rationale can properly be used to support a conclusion of
obviousness only when the claimed solution would have been selected from a finite
number of potential solutions known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 9:**  
The case of *Perfect Web Tech., Inc. v.
InfoUSA, Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1328-29, 92 USPQ2d 1849, 1854 (Fed.
Cir. 2009), provides an example in which the Federal Circuit held that a claimed
method for managing bulk email distribution was obvious on the basis of an obvious
to try argument. In *Perfect Web,* the method required selecting
the intended recipients, transmitting the emails, determining how many of the
emails had been successfully received, and repeating the first three steps if a
pre-determined minimum number of intended recipients had not received the email.  
The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court‚Äôs
determination on summary judgment that the claimed invention would have been
obvious. Failure to meet a desired quota of email recipients was a recognized
problem in the field of email marketing. The prior art had also recognized three
potential solutions: increasing the size of the initial recipient list; resending
emails to recipients who did not receive them on the first attempt; and selecting
a new recipient list and sending emails to them. The last option corresponded to
the fourth step of the invention as claimed.  
The Federal Circuit noted that based on ‚Äúsimple
logic,‚Äù selecting a new list of recipients was more likely to result in the
desired outcome than resending to those who had not received the email on the
first attempt. There had been no evidence of any unexpected result associated with
selecting a new recipient list, and no evidence that the method would not have had
a reasonable likelihood of success. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that, as
required by *KSR,* there were a ‚Äúfinite number of identified,
predictable solutions,‚Äù and that the obvious to try inquiry properly led to the
legal conclusion of obviousness.  
The Federal Circuit in *Perfect
Web* also discussed the role of common sense in the determination of
obviousness. The district court had cited *KSR* for the
proposition that ‚Äú[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary
creativity, not an automaton,‚Äù and found that ‚Äúthe final step [of the claimed
invention] is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim
‚Äòtry, try again.‚Äô‚Äù In affirming the district court, the Federal Circuit undertook
an extended discussion of common sense as it has been applied to the obviousness
inquiry, both before and since the *KSR* decision.  
The Federal Circuit pointed out that application of
common sense is not really an innovation in the law of obviousness when it stated,
‚ÄúCommon sense has long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness if
explained with sufficient reasoning.‚Äù *Perfect Web,* 587 F.3d at
1328, 92 USPQ2d at 1853 (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit then provided a
review of a number of precedential cases that inform the understanding of common
sense, including *In re Bozek,* 416 F.2d 1385, 1390, 163 USPQ
545, 549 (CCPA 1969) (explaining that a patent examiner may rely on ‚Äúcommon
knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any
specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference‚Äù) and *In re
Zurko,* 258 F.3d 1379, 1383, 1385, 59 USPQ2d 1693 at 1695, 1697 (Fed.
Cir. 2001) (clarifying that a factual foundation is needed in order for an
examiner to invoke ‚Äúgood common sense‚Äù in a case in which ‚Äúbasic knowledge and
common sense was not based on any evidence in the record‚Äù). The Federal Circuit
implicitly acknowledged in *Perfect Web* that the kind of strict
evidence-based teaching, suggestion, or motivation required in *In re
Lee,* 277 F.3d 1338, 1344, 61 USPQ2d 1430, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2002), is
not an absolute requirement for an obviousness rejection in light of the teachings
of *KSR.* The Federal Circuit explained that ‚Äú[a]t the time [of
the Lee decision], we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching,
suggestion, or motivation to combine references.‚Äù However, *Perfect
Web* went on to state that even under *Lee,* common
sense could properly be applied when analyzing evidence relevant to obviousness.
Citing *DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
1356, 80 USPQ2d 1641 (Fed. Cir. 2006), and *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d
977, 78 USPQ2d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006), two cases decided shortly before the Supreme
Court‚Äôs decision in *KSR,* the Federal Circuit noted that
although ‚Äúa reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations‚Äù is
required to use common sense, identification of a ‚Äúspecific hint or suggestion in
a particular reference‚Äù is not. See also *B/E Aerospace, Inc. v. C&D
Zodiac, Inc.,* 962 F.3d 1373, 1380-81, 2020 USPQ2d 10706 (Fed. Cir.
2020) (stating that ‚Äúthe Board‚Äôs invocation of common sense was properly
accompanied by reasoned analysis and evidentiary support‚Äù to show why it would be
obvious to incorporate a second recess to receive an airplane seat support). But
see *Arendi v. Apple,* 832 F.3d 1355, 119 USPQ2d 1822 (Fed. Cir.
2016) (finding that the Board had not provided a reasoned analysis, supported by
the evidence of record, for why ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù taught the missing process step).  
***F.******Known Work in One Field of Endeavor May Prompt Variations of It for Use
in Either the Same Field or a Different One Based on Design Incentives or Other
Market Forces if the Variations Are Predictable to One of Ordinary Skill in the
Art***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that the scope and content of the prior art, whether
in the same field of endeavor as that of the applicant‚Äôs invention or a
different field of endeavor, included a similar or analogous device (method, or
product);
- (2) a finding that there were design incentives or market forces
which would have prompted adaptation of the known device (method, or product);
- (3) a finding that the differences between the claimed invention
and the prior art were encompassed in known variations or in a principle known
in the prior art;
- (4) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art, in view of
the identified design incentives or other market forces, could have implemented
the claimed variation of the prior art, and the claimed variation would have
been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art; and
- (5) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claimed invention
would have been obvious is that design incentives or other market forces could have
prompted one of ordinary skill in the art to vary the prior art in a predictable
manner to result in the claimed invention. If any of these findings cannot be made,
then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
**Example 1:**  
The fact pattern in *Dann v. Johnston,* 425 U.S.
219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) is set forth above in Example 1 in subsection D.  
The Court found that the problem addressed by applicant ‚Äì the
need to give more detailed breakdown by a category of transactions ‚Äì was closely
analogous to the task of keeping track of the transaction files of individual
business units. *Id.* at 229, 189 USPQ at 261. Thus, an artisan
in the data processing area would have recognized the similar class of problem and
the known solutions of the prior art and it would have been well within the
ordinary skill level to implement the system in the different environment. The
Court held that ‚Äú[t]he gap between the prior art and respondent‚Äôs system is simply
not so great as to render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the
art.‚Äù  *Id.* at 230, 189 USPQ at 261.  
**Example 2:**  
The claimed invention in *Leapfrog Enterprises, Inc. v.
Fisher-Price, Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 82 USPQ2d 1687 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
was directed to a learning device to help young children read phonetically. The
claim read as follows:  
An interactive learning device, comprising:  
a housing including a plurality of switches;  
a sound production device in communication with the switches and
including a processor and a memory;  
at least one depiction of a sequence of letters, each letter
being associable with a switch; and  
a reader configured to communicate the identity of the depiction
to the processor,  
wherein selection of a depicted letter activates an associated
switch to communicate with the processor, causing the sound production device to
generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter,
the sound being determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of
letter.  
The court concluded that the claimed invention would have been
obvious in view of the combination of two pieces of prior art, (1) Bevan (which
showed an electro-mechanical toy for phonetic learning), (2) the Super Speak &
Read device (SSR) (an electronic reading toy), and the knowledge of one of
ordinary skill in the art.  
The court made clear that there was no technological advance
beyond the skill shown in the SSR device. The court stated that ‚Äúone of ordinary
skill in the art of children‚Äôs learning toys would have found it obvious to
combine the Bevan device with the SSR to update it using modern electronic
components in order to gain the commonly understood benefits of such adaptation,
such as decreased size, increased reliability, simplified operation, and reduced
cost. While the SSR only permits generation of a sound corresponding to the first
letter of a word, it does so using electronic means. The combination is thus the
adaptation of an old idea or invention (Bevan) using newer technology that is
commonly available and understood in the art (the SSR).‚Äù  
The court found that the claimed invention was but a variation on
already known children‚Äôs toys. This variation presented no nonobvious advance over
other toys. The court made clear that there was no technological advance beyond
the skill shown in the SSR device. The court found that ‚Äú[a]ccommodating a prior
art mechanical device that accomplishes that goal to modern electronics would have
been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary skill in designing children‚Äôs learning
devices. Applying modern electronics to older mechanical devices has been
commonplace in recent years.‚Äù  
**Example 3:**  
The claimed invention in *KSR Int'l Co. v.
Teleflex**Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007), was an adjustable
pedal assembly with a fixed pivot point and an electronic pedal-position sensor
attached to the assembly support. The fixed pivot point meant that the pivot was
not changed as the pedal was adjusted. The placement of the sensor on the assembly
support kept the sensor fixed while the pedal was adjusted.  
Conventional gas pedals operated by a mechanical link which
adjusted the throttle based on the travel of the pedal from a set position. The
throttle controlled the combustion process and the available power generated by
the engine. Newer cars used computer controlled throttles in which a sensor
detected the motion of the pedal and sent signals to the engine to adjust the
throttle accordingly. At the time of the invention, the marketplace provided a
strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior
art taught a number of methods for doing so. The prior art (Asano) taught an
adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point with mechanical throttle control. The
prior art (‚Äò936 patent to Byler) taught an electronic pedal sensor which was
placed on a pivot point in the pedal assembly and that it was preferable to detect
the pedal‚Äôs position in the pedal mechanism rather than in the engine. The prior
art (Smith) taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer
from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the
pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedal‚Äôs footpad. The prior art (Rixon)
taught an adjustable pedal assembly (sensor in the footpad) with an electronic
sensor for throttle control. There was no prior art electronic throttle control
that was combined with a pedal assembly which kept the pivot point fixed when
adjusting the pedal.  
The Court stated that ‚Äú[t]he proper question to have asked was
whether a pedal designer of ordinary skill, facing the wide range of needs created
by developments in the field of endeavor, would have seen a benefit to upgrading
Asano with a sensor.‚Äù *Id.* at 424, 82 USPQ2d at 1399. The Court
found that technological developments in the automotive design would have prompted
a designer to upgrade Asano with an electronic sensor. The next question was where
to attach the sensor. Based on the prior art, a designer would have known to place
the sensor on a nonmoving part of the pedal structure and the most obvious
nonmoving point on the structure from which a sensor can easily detect the pedal‚Äôs
position was a pivot point. The Court concluded that it would have been obvious to
upgrade Asano‚Äôs fixed pivot point adjustable pedal by replacing the mechanical
assembly for throttle control with an electronic throttle control and to mount the
electronic sensor on the pedal support structure.  
**Example 4:**  
The claimed invention in *Ex parte Catan,* 83
USPQ2d 1569 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2007), was a consumer electronics device
using bioauthentication to authorize sub-users of an authorized credit account to
place orders over a communication network up to a pre-set maximum sub-credit
limit.  
The prior art (Nakano) disclosed a consumer electronics device
like the claimed invention, except that security was provided by a password
authentication device rather than a bioauthentication device. The prior art
(Harada) disclosed that the use of a bioauthentication device (fingerprint sensor)
on a consumer electronics device (remote control) to provide bioauthentication
information (fingerprint) was known in the prior art at the time of the invention.
The prior art (Dethloff) also disclosed that it was known in the art at the time
of the invention to substitute bioauthentication for PIN authentication to enable
a user to access credit via a consumer electronics device.  
The Board found that the prior art ‚Äúshows that one of ordinary
skill in the consumer electronic device art at the time of the invention would
have been familiar with using bioauthentication information interchangeably with
or in lieu of PINs to authenticate users.‚Äù The Board concluded that one of
ordinary skill in the art of consumer electronic devices would have found it
obvious to update the prior art password device with the modern bioauthentication
component and thereby gain, predictably, the commonly understood benefits of such
adaptation, that is, a secure and reliable authentication procedure.  
***G.******Some Teaching, Suggestion, or Motivation in the Prior Art That Would Have
Led One of Ordinary Skill To Modify the Prior Art Reference or To Combine Prior
Art Reference Teachings To Arrive at the Claimed Invention***  
To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
articulate the following:  
- (1) a finding that there was some teaching, suggestion, or
motivation, either in the references themselves or in the knowledge generally
available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the reference or to
combine reference teachings;
- (2) a finding that there was reasonable expectation of success;
and
- (3) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.  
The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
been obvious is that "a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated
to combine the prior art to achieve the claimed invention and whether there would
have been a reasonable expectation of success in doing so."  *DyStar
Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
1356, 1360, 80 USPQ2d 1641, 1645 (Fed. Cir. 2006). If any of these findings cannot be
made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would
have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  
The courts have made clear that the teaching, suggestion, or
motivation test is flexible and an explicit suggestion to combine the prior art is
not necessary. The motivation to combine may be implicit and may be found in the
knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, or, in some cases, from the nature of
the problem to be solved. *Id.* at 1366, 80 USPQ2d at 1649. ‚Äú[A]n
implicit motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from
the prior art as a whole, but when the ‚Äòimprovement‚Äô is technology-independent and
the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable,
for example because it is stronger, cheaper, cleaner, faster, lighter, smaller, more
durable, or more efficient. Because the desire to enhance commercial opportunities by
improving a product or process is universal‚Äîand even common-sensical‚Äîwe have held
that there exists in these situations a motivation to combine prior art references
even absent any hint of suggestion in the references themselves. In such situations,
the proper question is whether the ordinary artisan possesses knowledge and skills
