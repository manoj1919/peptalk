# 2141 Examination Guidelines for Determining Obviousness Under 35 U.S.C. 103 [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an application
 is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject to the first
 inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is "before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the invention". See **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. Many of the court decisions discussed in this
 section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court
 decisions may be applicable to applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the relevant time is before the effective filing date of
 the claimed invention and not at the time of the invention.]*

#### *35 U.S.C. 103 Conditions for patentability; non-obvious subject matter.*

A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained,
 notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in **[section
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, if the differences between the claimed invention and the
 prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in
 the art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by
 the manner in which the invention was made. 

#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103 Conditions for patentability; nonobvious subject matter.*

- (a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention
 is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in **[section 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior
 art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the
 time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which
 said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner
 in which the invention was made.

**EXAMINATION GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING OBVIOUSNESS UNDER 35 U.S.C. 103**

These guidelines are intended to assist Office personnel to make a
 proper determination of obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, and to provide an
 appropriate supporting rationale in view of the decision by the Supreme Court in *KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. (KSR),* 550 U.S. 398, 82
 USPQ2d 1385 (2007). The guidelines are based on the Office’s current understanding of
 the law, and are believed to be fully consistent with the binding precedent of the
 Supreme Court. The *KSR* decision reinforced earlier decisions that
 validated a more flexible approach to providing reasons for obviousness. However, the
 Supreme Court’s pronouncement in *KSR* overruled cases such as *In re Lee,* 277 F.3d 1338, 61 USPQ2d 1430 (Fed. Cir. 2002), insofar
 as those cases require record evidence of an express reason to modify the prior art. As
 the Federal Circuit has explained: 
> At the time [of the decision in *In re
> Lee*], we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching,
> suggestion, or motivation to combine references because “[o]mission of a relevant
> factor required by precedent is both legal error and arbitrary agency action.”
> However, this did not preclude examiners from employing common sense. More recently
> [in *DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d 1356,
> 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2006)], we explained that use of common sense does not require a
> “specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference,” only a reasoned explanation
> that avoids conclusory generalizations.

*Perfect Web Technologies, Inc. v. InfoUSA,
 Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1329, 92 USPQ2d 1849, 1854 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citations
 omitted). 

In another case, the Federal Circuit also stated
 that: 
> “… we conclude that while ‘common sense’ can be
> invoked, even potentially to supply a limitation missing from the prior art, it must
> still be supported by evidence and a reasoned explanation....[T]his is particularly
> true where the missing limitation goes to the heart of an invention.”

*Arendi v. Apple,* 832 F.3d 1355, 1363,
 119 USPQ2d 1822, 1827 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

These guidelines do not constitute substantive rule making and hence do
 not have the force and effect of law. They have been developed as a matter of internal
 Office management and are not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or
 procedural, enforceable by any party against the Office. Rejections continue to be based
 upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections that are appealable. Consequently,
 any failure by Office personnel to follow the guidelines is neither appealable nor
 petitionable. 

**I.** **THE *KSR* DECISION AND PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF
 OBVIOUSNESS**

The Supreme Court in *KSR* reaffirmed the familiar
 framework for determining obviousness as set forth in *Graham v. John Deere
 Co*., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), but stated that the Federal
 Circuit had erred by applying the teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test in an
 overly rigid and formalistic way. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 404, 82 USPQ2d
 at 1391. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that the Federal Circuit had erred in
 four ways: (1) “by holding that courts and patent examiners should look only to the
 problem the patentee was trying to solve ” *(Id.* at 420, 82 USPQ2d
 at 1397); (2) by assuming “that a person of ordinary skill attempting to solve a
 problem will be led only to those elements of prior art designed to solve the same
 problem” *(Id.);* (3) by concluding “that a patent claim cannot be
 proved obvious merely by showing that the combination of elements was ‘obvious to
 try’” *(Id.* at 421, USPQ2d at 1397); and (4) by overemphasizing
 “the risk of courts and patent examiners falling prey to hindsight bias” and as a
 result applying “[r]igid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common
 sense” *(Id.)*. See also *Novartis Pharms. Corp. v.
 West-Ward Pharms. Int'l Ltd.,* 923 F.3d 1051, 1059, 2019 USPQ2d 171676
 (Fed. Cir. 2019); *Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co.,* 839 F.3d 1034,
 1047-48, 120 USPQ2d 1400, 1410 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and *Aventis Pharma S.A. v.
 Hospira, Inc.,* 675 F.3d 1324, 1332, 102 USPQ2d 1445, 1449 (Fed. Cir.
 2012). 

In *KSR,* the Supreme Court particularly
 emphasized “the need for caution in granting a patent based on the combination of
 elements found in the prior art,”*Id.* at 415, 82 USPQ2d at 1395,
 and discussed circumstances in which a patent might be determined to be obvious.
 Importantly, the Supreme Court reaffirmed principles based on its precedent that
 “[t]he combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be
 obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.”*Id.* at 415-16, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. The Supreme Court stated that there are “[t]hree cases
 decided after *Graham* [that] illustrate this doctrine.” *Id.* at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. (1) “In *United States
 v. Adams,* . . . [t]he Court recognized that when a patent claims a
 structure already known in the prior art that is altered by the mere substitution of
 one element for another known in the field, the combination must do more than yield a
 predictable result.” *Id.* (2) “In *Anderson’s-Black Rock,
 Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co.,* . . . [t]he two [pre-existing elements] in
 combination did no more than they would in separate, sequential operation.” *Id.* at 416-17, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. (3) “[I]n *Sakraida
 v. AG Pro, Inc.,* the Court derived . . . the conclusion that when a
 patent simply arranges old elements with each performing the same function it had
 been known to perform and yields no more than one would expect from such an
 arrangement, the combination is obvious.” *Id.* at 417, 82 USPQ2d at
 1395-96 (Internal quotations omitted.). The principles underlining these cases are
 instructive when the question is whether a patent application claiming the
 combination of elements of prior art would have been obvious. The Supreme Court
 further stated that: 
> When a work is available in one field of endeavor, design
> incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of it, either in the same
> field or a different one. If a person of ordinary skill can implement a
> predictable variation, **[§ 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** likely bars its
> patentability. For the same reason, if a technique has been used to improve one
> device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would
> improve similar devices in the same way, using the technique is obvious unless its
> actual application is beyond his or her skill. *Id.* at 417, 82
> USPQ2d at 1396.

When considering obviousness of a combination of known elements,
 the operative question is thus “whether the improvement is more than the predictable
 use of prior art elements according to their established functions.” *Id.*

The Supreme Court’s flexible approach to the
 obviousness inquiry is reflected in numerous pre-*KSR* decisions;
 see **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**. That section provides many lines of reasoning to
 support a determination of obviousness based upon earlier legal precedent that had
 condoned the use of particular examples of what may be considered common sense or
 ordinary routine practice (e.g., making integral, changes in shape, making
 adjustable). Thus, the type of reasoning sanctioned by the opinion in KSR has long
 been part of the patent examination process. 

**II.** **THE BASIC FACTUAL INQUIRIES OF *GRAHAM v. JOHN DEERE CO.***

An invention that would have been obvious to a person of ordinary
 skill at the relevant time is not patentable. See **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. As
 reiterated by the Supreme Court in *KSR,* the framework for the
 objective analysis for determining obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is stated in *Graham v. John Deere Co.,* 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459
 (1966). Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual inquiries. The
 factual inquiries enunciated by the Court are as follows: 

- (A) Determining the scope and content of the prior art;
- (B) Ascertaining the differences between the claimed invention and
 the prior art; and
- (C) Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent
 art.


Objective evidence relevant to the issue of obviousness must be
 evaluated by Office personnel. *Id.* at 17-18, 148 USPQ at 467. Such
 evidence, sometimes referred to as “secondary considerations,” may include evidence
 of commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, and
 unexpected results. The evidence may be included in the specification as filed,
 accompany the application on filing, or be provided in a timely manner at some other
 point during the prosecution. The weight to be given any objective evidence is
 determined on a case-by-case basis. The mere fact that an applicant has presented
 evidence does not mean that the evidence is dispositive of the issue of
 obviousness. 

The question of obviousness must be resolved on the basis of the
 factual inquiries set forth above. While each case is different and must be decided
 on its own facts, these factual inquiries, as well as secondary considerations when
 present, must be analyzed. The *Graham* factors were reaffirmed and
 relied upon by the Supreme Court in its consideration and determination of
 obviousness in the fact situation presented in *KSR,* 550 U.S. at
 406-07, 82 USPQ2d at 1391 (2007). The Supreme Court has utilized the *Graham* factors in each of its obviousness decisions since *Graham.* See *Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc.,* 425
 U.S. 273, 189 USPQ 449, *reh’g denied,* 426 U.S. 955 (1976); *Dann v. Johnston,* 425 U.S. 219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976); and *Anderson’s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co.,* 396 U.S.
 57, 163 USPQ 673 (1969). As stated by the Supreme Court in *KSR,* “While the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any particular case, the
 [*Graham*] factors continue to define the inquiry that
 controls.”*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 407, 82 USPQ2d at 1391. 

***Office Personnel As Factfinders***

Office personnel fulfill the critical role of factfinder when
 resolving the *Graham* inquiries. It must be remembered that
 while the ultimate determination of obviousness is a legal conclusion, the
 underlying *Graham* inquiries are factual. When making an
 obviousness rejection, Office personnel must therefore ensure that the written
 record includes findings of fact concerning the state of the art and the teachings
 of the references applied. In certain circumstances, it may also be important to
 include explicit findings as to how a person of ordinary skill would have
 understood prior art teachings, or what a person of ordinary skill would have
 known or could have done. Factual findings made by Office personnel are the
 necessary underpinnings to establish obviousness. 

Once the findings of fact are articulated, Office personnel must
 provide an explanation to support an obviousness rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** requires that
 the applicant be notified of the reasons for the rejection of the claim so that
 the applicant can decide how best to proceed. Clearly setting forth findings of
 fact and the rationale(s) to support a rejection in an Office action leads to the
 prompt resolution of issues pertinent to patentability. 

In short, the focus when making a determination of obviousness
 should be on what a person of ordinary skill in the pertinent art would have known
 at the relevant time, and on what such a person would have reasonably expected to
 have been able to do in view of that knowledge. This is so regardless of whether
 the source of that knowledge and ability was documentary prior art, general
 knowledge in the art, or common sense. What follows is a discussion of the *Graham* factual inquiries. 

***A.******Determining the Scope and Content of the Prior Art***

In determining the scope and content of the prior art, Office
 personnel must first obtain a thorough understanding of the invention disclosed
 and claimed in the application under examination by reading the specification,
 including the claims, to understand what has been invented. See **[MPEP §
 904](s904.html#d0e115569)**. The scope of the claimed invention must be
 clearly determined by giving the claims the “broadest reasonable interpretation
 consistent with the specification.” See *Phillips v. AWH
 Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303, 1316, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
 and **[MPEP
 § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)**. Once the scope of the claimed invention is
 determined, Office personnel must then determine what to search for and where
 to search. 

**1.** **What To Search For:**

The search should cover the claimed subject matter and
 should also cover the disclosed features which might reasonably be expected
 to be claimed. See **[MPEP § 904.02](s904.html#d0e115698)**. Although a
 rejection need not be based on a teaching or suggestion to combine, a
 preferred search will be directed to finding references that provide such a
 teaching or suggestion if they exist. 

**2.** **Where To Search:**

Office personnel should continue to follow the general
 search guidelines set forth in **[MPEP § 904](s904.html#d0e115569)** to **[§ 904.03](s904.html#d0e115840)** regarding search of the prior art.
 Office personnel are reminded that, for purposes of **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, prior art can be either in the field of the
 inventor’s endeavor or be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem
 with which the inventor was concerned. See **[MPEP §
 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208985)** for a discussion of analogous art and **[MPEP §
 1504.03](s1504.html#d0e154792)** for a discussion of analogous art for
 design applications. Furthermore, prior art that is in a field of endeavor
 other than that of the inventor (as noted by the Court in *KSR,* “[w]hen a work is available in one field of
 endeavor, design incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of
 it, either in the same field or a different one,” 550
 U.S. at 417, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (emphasis added)), or solves a problem which
 is different from that which the inventor was trying to solve, may also be
 considered for the purposes of **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. (The
 Court in *KSR* stated that “[t]he first error…in this case
 was…holding that courts and patent examiners should look only to the problem
 the patentee was trying to solve. The Court of Appeals failed to recognize
 that the problem motivating the patentee may be only one of many addressed
 by the patent’s subject matter…The second error [was]…that a person of
 ordinary skill attempting to solve a problem will be led only to those
 elements of prior art designed to solve the same problem.” 550 U.S. at 420,
 82 USPQ2d at 1397. Federal Circuit case law prior to the Supreme Court’s
 decision in *KSR* is generally in accord with these
 statements by the *KSR* Court. See e.g., *In re
 Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 693, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1902 (Fed. Cir.
 1990) *(en banc)* (“[I]t is not necessary in order to
 establish a *prima facie* case of obviousness that both a
 structural similarity between a claimed and prior art compound (or a key
 component of a composition) be shown and that there be a suggestion in or
 expectation from **the prior art** that the claimed compound or
 composition will have the same or a similar utility **as one newly
 discovered by applicant**”) (emphasis added); *In re
 Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 1016, 173 USPQ 560, 562 (CCPA 1972)
 (“The fact that appellant uses sugar for a different purpose does not alter
 the conclusion that its use in a prior art composition would be *prima facie* obvious from the purpose disclosed in the
 references.”). 

For a discussion of what constitutes prior art, see **[MPEP §
 901](s901.html#d0e110011)** to **[§ 901.06(d)](s901.html#d0e113237)** and **[§
 2121](s2121.html#d0e201731)** to **[§ 2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)**. See **[MPEP §
 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208985)** for a discussion of analogous art and **[MPEP §
 1504.03](s1504.html#d0e154792)** for a discussion of analogous art for
 design applications. 

***B.******Ascertaining the Differences Between the Claimed Invention and the
 Prior Art***

Ascertaining the differences between the claimed invention
 and the prior art requires interpreting the claim language, see **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)**, and considering both the invention and the
 prior art as a whole. See **[MPEP § 2141.02](s2141.html#d0e209106)**. 

***C.******Resolving the Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art***

Any obviousness rejection should include, either explicitly
 or implicitly in view of the prior art applied, an indication of the level of
 ordinary skill. See **[MPEP § 2141.03](s2143.html#d0e210501)**, subsection II,
 regarding implicit indication of the level of ordinary skill. A finding as to
 the level of ordinary skill may be used as a partial basis for a resolution of
 the issue of obviousness. 

The person of ordinary skill in the art is a hypothetical
 person who is presumed to have known the relevant art at the relevant time.
 Factors that may be considered in determining the level of ordinary skill in
 the art may include: (1) “type of problems encountered in the art;” (2) “prior
 art solutions to those problems;” (3) “rapidity with which innovations are
 made;” (4) “sophistication of the technology; and” (5) “educational level of
 active workers in the field.” *In re GPAC,* 57 F.3d 1573,
 1579, 35 USPQ2d 1116, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 1995). “In a given case, every factor may
 not be present, and one or more factors may predominate.” *Id.* See also *Custom Accessories, Inc. v.
 Jeffrey-Allan Indust., Inc.,* 807 F.2d 955, 962, 1 USPQ2d 1196,
 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1986); *Environmental Designs, Ltd. v. Union Oil
 Co.,* 713 F.2d 693, 696, 218 USPQ 865, 868 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 

“A person of ordinary skill in the art is also a person of
 ordinary creativity, not an automaton.”*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 421,
 82 USPQ2d at 1397. “[I]n many cases a person of ordinary skill will be able to
 fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a
 puzzle.”*Id.* at 420, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. Office personnel
 may also take into account “the inferences and creative steps that a person of
 ordinary skill in the art would employ.”*Id.* at 418, 82
 USPQ2d at 1396. 

In addition to the factors above, Office personnel may rely
 on their own technical expertise to describe the knowledge and skills of a
 person of ordinary skill in the art. The Federal Circuit has stated that
 examiners and administrative patent judges on the Board are “persons of
 scientific competence in the fields in which they work” and that their findings
 are “informed by their scientific knowledge, as to the meaning of prior art
 references to persons of ordinary skill in the art.” *In re
 Berg,* 320 F.3d 1310, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 2003, 2007 (Fed. Cir. 2003).
 In addition, examiners “are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the
 references and to be familiar from their work with the level of skill in the
 art .” *PowerOasis, Inc. v. T-Mobile USA, Inc.,* 522 F.3d
 1299, 86 USPQ2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting *Am. Hoist & Derrick
 Co. v. Sowa & Sons,* 725 F.2d 1350, 1360, 220 USPQ 763, 770
 (Fed. Cir. 1984). See **[MPEP § 2141.03](s2141.html#d0e209300)** for a
 discussion of the level of ordinary skill. 

**III.** **RATIONALES TO SUPPORT REJECTIONS UNDER 35 U.S.C. 103**

Once the *Graham* factual inquiries are resolved,
 Office personnel must determine whether the claimed invention would have been obvious as
 of the relevant time to one of ordinary skill in the art. 
> The obviousness analysis cannot be confined by . . . overemphasis on
> the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued
> patents. . . . . In many fields it may be that there is little discussion of obvious
> techniques or combinations, and it often may be the case that market demand, rather
> than scientific literature, will drive design trends.*KSR,* 550 U.S.
> at 419, 82 USPQ2d at 1396.

Prior art is not limited just to the references being applied, but
 includes the understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art. The prior art reference
 (or references when combined) need not teach or suggest all the claim limitations.
 However, Office personnel must explain why the difference(s) between the prior art and
 the claimed invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. The
 “mere existence of differences between the prior art and an invention does not establish
 the invention’s nonobviousness.” *Dann v. Johnston,* 425 U.S. 219, 230,
 189 USPQ 257, 261 (1976). The gap between the prior art and the claimed invention may
 not be “so great as to render the [claim] nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the
 art.” *Id.* In determining obviousness, neither the particular
 motivation to make the claimed invention nor the problem the inventor is solving
 controls. The proper analysis is whether the claimed invention would have been obvious
 as of the relevant time to one of ordinary skill in the art after consideration of all
 the facts. See **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Factors other than the disclosures of the cited prior art
 may provide a basis for concluding that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
 skill in the art to bridge the gap. The rationales discussed below outline reasoning
 that may be applied to find obviousness in such cases. 

If the search of the prior art and the resolution of the *Graham* factual inquiries reveal that an obviousness rejection may
 be made using the familiar teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) rationale, then such a
 rejection is appropriate. Although the Supreme Court in *KSR* cautioned
 against an overly rigid application of TSM, it also recognized that TSM was one of a
 number of valid rationales that could be used to determine obviousness. (According to
 the Supreme Court, establishment of the TSM approach to the question of obviousness
 “captured a helpful insight.” 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (citing *In re
 Bergel,* 292 F.2d 955, 956-57, 130 USPQ 206, 207-208 (1961)). Furthermore,
 the Court explained that “[t]here is no necessary inconsistency between the idea
 underlying the TSM test and the *Graham* analysis.” 550 U.S. at 419, 82
 USPQ2d at 1396. The Supreme Court also commented that the Federal Circuit “no doubt has
 applied the test in accord with these principles [set forth in *KSR*]
 in many cases.” *Id.* Office personnel should also consider whether one
 or more of the other rationales set forth below supports a conclusion of obviousness.
 The Court in *KSR* identified a number of rationales to support a
 conclusion of obviousness which are consistent with the proper “functional approach” to
 the determination of obviousness as laid down in *Graham*. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415-21, 82 USPQ2d at 1395-97. Note that the list
 of rationales provided below is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. Other
 rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness may be relied upon by Office
 personnel. Consistent with *KSR,* the Federal Circuit stated that the
 obviousness analysis is not “confined by a formalistic conception of the words teaching,
 suggestion, and motivation.” *Intel Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc.,* 21 F.4th
 784, 795, 2021 USPQ2d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at
 419, 82 USPQ2d at 1396). See also *In re Ethicon, Inc.,* 844 F.3d 1344,
 1350, 121 USPQ2d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (recalling that the Supreme Court has
 instructed decisionmakers to “apply ‘an expansive and flexible approach’ to
 obviousness”) (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415, 82 USPQ2d at 1395). 

The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is
 the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been
 obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted that the analysis supporting
 a rejection under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. The Court quoting *In
 re Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006), stated
 that “‘[R]ejections on obviousness cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements;
 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to
 support the legal conclusion of obviousness.’” *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418,
 82 USPQ2d at 1396. See also *Adapt Pharma Operations Ltd. v. Teva Pharms. USA,
 Inc.,* 25 F.4th 1354, 1365, 2022 USPQ2d 144 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (stating that a
 determination of obviousness “requires ‘identify[ing] a reason that would have prompted
 a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the
 claimed new invention does’” (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d
 at 1395). Examples of rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness include: 

- (A) Combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield
 predictable results;
- (B) Simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain
 predictable results;
- (C) Use of known technique to improve similar devices (methods, or
 products) in the same way;
- (D) Applying a known technique to a known device (method, or product)
 ready for improvement to yield predictable results;
- (E) “Obvious to try” – choosing from a finite number of identified,
 predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success;
- (F) Known work in one field of endeavor may prompt variations of it
 for use in either the same field or a different one based on design incentives or
 other market forces if the variations are predictable to one of ordinary skill in
 the art;
- (G) Some teaching, suggestion, or motivation in the prior art that
 would have led one of ordinary skill to modify the prior art reference or to
 combine prior art reference teachings to arrive at the claimed invention.


See **[MPEP § 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)** for a discussion of the rationales listed above
 along with examples illustrating how the cited rationales may be used to support a
 finding of obviousness. See also **[MPEP § 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)** - **[§ 2144.09](s2144.html#d0e212153)** for
 additional guidance regarding support for obviousness determinations. 

**IV.** **APPLICANT’S REPLY**

Once Office personnel have issued a rejection that establishes the *Graham* factual findings and concludes, in view of the relevant
 evidence of record at that time, that the claimed invention would have been obvious as
 of the relevant time, the burden then shifts to the applicant to (A) show that the
 Office erred in these findings or (B) provide other evidence to show that the claimed
 subject matter would have been nonobvious. **[37 CFR 1.111(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449)** requires applicant
 to distinctly and specifically point out the supposed errors in the Office’s action and
 reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the Office action. The reply must
 present arguments pointing out the specific distinction believed to render the claims
 patentable over any applied references. 

If an applicant disagrees with any factual findings by the Office, an
 effective traverse of a rejection based wholly or partially on such findings must
 include a reasoned statement explaining why the applicant believes the Office has erred
 substantively as to the factual findings. A mere statement or argument that the Office
 has not established a *prima facie* case of obviousness or that the
 Office’s reliance on common knowledge is unsupported by documentary evidence will not be
 considered substantively adequate to rebut the rejection or an effective traverse of the
 rejection under **[37 CFR
 1.111(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449)**. Office personnel addressing this situation may repeat
 the rejection made in the prior Office action and make the next Office action final. See **[MPEP §
 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e68889)**. 

An applicant’s reply could also establish that a
 disclosure relied on in an obviousness rejection is not in fact prior art in view of a **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** exception, or that subject matter, although prior art, is
 disqualified for use in an obviousness rejection in view of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See **[MPEP §§ 2146](s2146.html#d0e213206)**, **[2153.01](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_24caf_cd)** and **[2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**. See also **[MPEP §
 2155](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_16784_56)** regarding affidavits or declarations under **[37 CFR
 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** to overcome prior art rejections. 

**V.** **CONSIDERATION OF APPLICANT’S REBUTTAL EVIDENCE**

Office personnel should consider all rebuttal evidence that is timely
 presented by the applicants when reevaluating any obviousness determination. Rebuttal
 evidence may include evidence of “secondary considerations,” such as “commercial
 success, long felt but unsolved needs, [and] failure of others” *(Graham v. John
 Deere Co.,* 383 U.S. at 17, 148 USPQ at 467), and may also include evidence
 of unexpected results. As set forth above, Office personnel must articulate findings of
 fact that support the rationale relied upon in an obviousness rejection. As a result,
 applicants are likely to submit evidence to rebut the fact finding made by Office
 personnel. For example, in the case of a claim to a combination, applicants may submit
 evidence or argument to demonstrate that: 

- (A) one of ordinary skill in the art could not have combined the
 claimed elements by known methods (e.g., due to technological difficulties);
- (B) the elements in combination do not merely perform the function
 that each element performs separately; or
- (C) the results of the claimed combination were unexpected.


Once the applicant has presented rebuttal evidence, Office personnel
 should reconsider any initial obviousness determination in view of the entire record.
 See, e.g., *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 1472, 223 USPQ 785, 788
 (Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re Eli Lilly & Co.,* 902 F.2d 943, 945, 14
 USPQ2d 1741, 1743 (Fed. Cir. 1990). All the rejections of record and proposed rejections
 and their bases should be reviewed to confirm their continued viability. The Office
 action should clearly communicate the Office’s findings and conclusions, articulating
 how the conclusions are supported by the findings. The procedures set forth in **[MPEP §
 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e68889)** are to be followed in determining whether an action
 may be made final. 

See **[MPEP
 § 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)** concerning consideration of applicant’s rebuttal
 evidence. See also **[MPEP §
 716](s716.html#d0e92085)** to **[§ 716.10](s716.html#d0e93797)** regarding affidavits or
 declarations filed under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** for purposes of
 traversing grounds of rejection. 

# 2141.01 Scope and Content of the Prior Art [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an
 application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject
 to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is
 "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject
 to **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the
 invention". See **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. Many of the
 court decisions discussed in this section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court decisions may be applicable to
 applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the
 relevant time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at
 the time of the invention.]*

**I.** **PRIOR ART AVAILABLE UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 IS AVAILABLE UNDER 35 U.S.C.
 103**

“Before answering *Graham’s* ‘content’ inquiry, it
 must be known whether a patent or publication is in the prior art under **[35 U.S.C. §
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.” *Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co.,* 810 F.2d 1561, 1568, 1 USPQ2d 1593, 1597 (Fed. Cir.), *cert.
 denied,* 481 U.S. 1052 (1987). Subject matter that is prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** can be used to support a rejection under **[section
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**. *Ex parte Andresen,* 212 USPQ 100, 102
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981) (“it appears to us that the commentator [of 35
 U.S.C.A.] and the [congressional] committee viewed **[section 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** as
 including all of the various bars to a patent as set forth in **[section 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.”).
 See also *In re Wertheim,* 646 F.2d 527, 532, 209 USPQ 554, 560
 (CCPA 1981) (“Commensurate with the Senate Report and Mr. Federico's commentary, we
 have held that the term ‘prior art’ refers ‘to at least the statutory prior art
 material named in **[§
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.’”); and *In re Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d 269,
 273, 158 USPQ 596, 600 (CCPA 1968) (“[w]hile **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is not directly
 involved in the issue on review, the conditions for patentability, novelty and loss
 of right to patent, there stated, may have relevance as to the disclosure which must
 be found in the prior art to find obviousness of an invention under **[section
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.”). 

Furthermore, admitted prior art can be relied upon for both
 anticipation and obviousness determinations, regardless of whether the admitted prior
 art would otherwise qualify as prior art under the statutory categories of **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. *Riverwood Int’l Corp. v. R.A. Jones &
 Co.,* 324 F.3d 1346, 1354, 66 USPQ2d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *Constant v. Advanced Micro-Devices Inc.,* 848 F.2d 1560, 1570, 7
 USPQ2d 1057, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1988). See **[MPEP § 2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)** for discussion of
 admissions as prior art. 

An obviousness rejection is ordinarily based on a disclosure that
 qualifies as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. If it is established that a disclosure does not
 qualify as prior art under an appropriate section of **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, then the disclosure is also not prior art that can be used
 in an obviousness rejection. For instance, for a claimed invention subject to **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, a **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** reference
 used in an anticipation rejection but overcome by submitting a declaration under **[37 CFR
 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** cannot be used in an obviousness rejection. Likewise,
 for a claimed invention subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, a **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** reference used in an anticipation rejection but
 overcome by submitting a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** cannot be used in an
 obviousness rejection. 

For an overview of what constitutes prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102,](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** see **[MPEP § 901](s901.html#d0e110011)** - **[§ 901.06(d)](s901.html#d0e113539)**, **[§ 2121](s2121.html#d0e201731)** - **[§ 2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)** and **[§
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)** - **[§ 2155](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_16784_56)**. 

**II.** **SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT OF THE PRIOR ART**

See **[MPEP § 2121](s2121.html#d0e201731)** - **[§ 2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)** for case law relating to the
 substantive content of the prior art (e.g., availability of inoperative devices,
 extent to which prior art must be enabling, broad disclosure rather than preferred
 embodiments, admissions, etc.). 

**III.** **CONTENT OF THE PRIOR ART IS DETERMINED AT THE RELEVANT TIME TO AVOID
 HINDSIGHT**

The purpose of the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** requirement “at the time the invention was made” is to avoid impermissible hindsight.
 Likewise, the **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** requirement
 “before the effective filing date of the claimed invention” serves the same purpose.
 See **[MPEP §
 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**, subsection X.A. for a discussion of rebutting
 applicants’ arguments that a rejection is based on hindsight. 

In the pre-AIA context, the Federal Circuit stated, “[i]t is
 difficult but necessary that the decisionmaker forget what he or she has been taught
 . . . about the claimed invention and cast the mind back to the time the invention
 was made (often as here many years), to occupy the mind of one skilled in the art.
 ...” *W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d
 1540, 1553, 220 USPQ 303, 313 (Fed. Cir. 1983), *cert. denied,* 469
 U.S. 851 (1984). Although the AIA has changed the relevant time focus to “before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention,” the observation expressed by the
 Federal Circuit otherwise continues to apply. 

**IV.** **PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) COMMON OWNERSHIP— REQUIRED FOR THE CONDITIONS OF
 PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)**

An applicant subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** who wants
 to rely on **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** to overcome an obviousness rejection has the
 burden of establishing that subject matter which only qualifies as prior art under
 subsection **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** of **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** used in a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** and the claimed invention were, at the time the
 invention was made, owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of
 assignment to the same person. Likewise, an applicant who wants to rely on the joint
 research provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** (for
 applications pending on or after December 10, 2004) has the burden of establishing
 that: 

- (A) the claimed invention was made by or on behalf of parties to a
 joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the date the claimed
 invention was made;
- (B) the claimed invention was made as a result of activities
 undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement; and
- (C) the application for patent for the claimed invention discloses
 or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to the joint research
 agreement.


These prior art disqualifications under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** are only applicable for subject matter which only
 qualifies as prior art under subsection **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and is used
 in a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. 

Note that for applications filed prior to November 29, 1999, and granted as patents prior to December 10, 2004, **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is limited on its face to subject matter
 developed by another person which qualifies as prior art only under subsection **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.

 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection with a terminal
 disclaimer by alleging that the public policy intent of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** was to prohibit the use of “secret” prior art in
 obviousness determinations. The court rejected this argument, holding “We may not
 disregard the unambiguous exclusion of **[§ 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** from the statute’s
 purview.”). 

See **[MPEP § 2146.02](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12765_27)** for the requirements

# 2141.01(a) Analogous and Nonanalogous Art [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an
 application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant
 time is "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the

**I.** **TO RELY ON A REFERENCE UNDER 35 U.S.C. 103, IT MUST BE ANALOGOUS ART TO THE
 CLAIMED INVENTION**

In order for a reference to be proper for use in an obviousness
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** , the reference must be analogous art to the
 claimed invention. *In re Bigio,* 381 F.3d 1320, 1325, 72 USPQ2d
 1209, 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004). A reference is analogous art to the claimed invention
 if: (1) the reference is from the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention
 (even if it addresses a different problem); or (2) the reference is reasonably
 pertinent to the problem faced by the inventor (even if it is not in the same
 field of endeavor as the claimed invention). Note that “same field of endeavor”
 and “reasonably pertinent” are two separate tests for establishing analogous art;
 it is not necessary for a reference to fulfill both tests in order to qualify as
 analogous art. See *Bigio,* 381 F.3d at 1325, 72 USPQ2d at 1212.
 The examiner must determine whether a reference is analogous art to the claimed
 invention when analyzing the obviousness of the subject matter under examination.
 When more than one prior art reference is used as the basis of an obviousness
 rejection, it is not required that the references be analogous art to each other.
 See *Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GMbH v. Mylan Pharms. Inc.,* 66
 F.4th 1373, 1380, 2023 USPQ2d 552 (Fed. Cir. 2023) and *Corephotonics,
 Ltd. v. Apple Inc.,* 84 F.4th 990, 1007, 2023 USPQ2d 1202 (Fed. Cir.
 2023). If a reference is not analogous art to the claimed invention, it may not be
 used in an obviousness rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. However, there
 is no analogous art requirement for a reference being applied in an anticipation
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**. *In re
 Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir.
 1997). 

When determining whether the “relevant field of
 endeavor” test is met, the examiner should consider “explanations of the
 invention’s subject matter in the patent application, including the embodiments,
 function, and structure of the claimed invention.” *Airbus S.A.S. v.
 Firepass Corp.,* 941 F.3d 1374, 1380, 2019 USPQ2d 430083 (Fed. Cir.
 2019) (quoting *Bigio,* 381 F.3d at 1325, 72 USPQ2d at 1212).
 When determining whether a prior art reference meets the “same field of endeavor”
 test for the analogous art, the primary focus is on what the reference discloses. *Airbus,* 41 F.3d at 1380. The examiner must consider the
 disclosure of each reference “in view of the ‘the reality of the circumstances.’” *Airbus,* 41 F.3d at 1380 (quoting *Bigio,* 381 F.3d at 1326, 72 USPQ2d at 1212). These circumstances are to be weighed “from
 the vantage point of the common sense likely to be exerted by one of ordinary
 skill in the art in assessing the scope of the endeavor.” *Airbus,* 41 F.3d at 1380. See also *Donner
 Technology, LLC v. Pro Stage Gear, LLC,* 979 F.3d 1353, 2020 USPQ2d
 11335 (Fed. Cir. 2020); *Sanofi-Aventis,* 66 F.4th at 1378; and *Netflix, Inc. v. DivX, LLC,* 80 F.4th 1352, 1358-59, 2023
 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (“The field of endeavor is ‘not limited to the
 specific point of novelty, the narrowest possible conception of the field, or the
 particular focus within a given field.’”) (quoting *Unwired Planet, LLC v.
 Google Inc.,* 841 F.3d 995, 1001, 120 USPQ2d 1593, 1597 (Fed. Cir.
 2016)). 

As for the “reasonably pertinent” test, the examiner
 should consider the problem faced by the inventor, as reflected - either
 explicitly or implicitly - in the specification. In order for a reference to be
 "reasonably pertinent" to the problem, it must "logically [] have commended itself
 to an inventor's attention in considering his problem." *In re ICON Health
 and Fitness, Inc.,* 496 F.3d 1374, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting *In re Clay,* 966 F.2d 656,658, 23 USPQ2d 1058, 1061 (Fed.
 Cir. 1992)). See also *In re Klein,* 647 F.3d 1343, 1348, 98
 USPQ2d 1991, 1993 (Fed. Cir. 2011) An inventor is not expected to have been aware
 of all prior art outside of the field of endeavor. *Airbus,* 41
 F.3d at 1380-82. A reference outside of the field of endeavor is reasonably
 pertinent if a person of ordinary skill would have consulted it and applied its
 teachings when faced with the problem that the inventor was trying to solve. *Airbus,* 41 F.3d at 1380-82. In order to support a
 determination that a reference is reasonably pertinent, it may be appropriate to
 include a statement of the examiner's understanding of the problem. The question
 of whether a reference is reasonably pertinent often turns on how the problem to
 be solved is perceived. If the problem to be solved is viewed in a narrow or
 constrained way, and such a view is not consistent with the specification, the
 scope of available prior art may be inappropriately limited. It may be necessary
 for the examiner to explain why an inventor seeking to solve the identified
 problem would have looked to the reference in an attempt to find a solution to the
 problem, i.e., factual reasons why the prior art is pertinent to the identified
 problem. See *Donner Tech., LLC v. Pro Stage Gear, LLC,* 979 F.3d
 1353, 1359, 2020 USPQ2d 11335 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (“Thus, when addressing whether a
 reference is analogous art with respect to the claimed invention under a
 reasonable-pertinence theory, the problems to which both relate must be identified
 and compared.”). 

The Supreme Court’s decision in *KSR Int'l
 Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007), did not
 change the test for analogous art as stated in *Bigio.* Under *Bigio,* a reference need not be from the same field of
 endeavor as the claimed invention in order to be analogous art. *Bigio,* 381 F.3d at 1325, 72 USPQ2d at 1212. This is
 consistent with the Supreme Court's instruction in *KSR* that
 "[w]hen a work is available in one field of endeavor, design incentives and other
 market forces can prompt variations of it, either in the same field or a different
 one." *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 417, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. The Federal
 Circuit reads *KSR* as “direct[ing] us to construe the scope of
 analogous art broadly” because “*familiar items may have obvious uses
 beyond their primary purposes,* and a person of ordinary skill often
 will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a
 puzzle.” *Wyers v. Master Lock Co.,* 616 F.3d 1231, 1238, 95
 USPQ2d 1525, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at
 402, 127 S. Ct. at 1727). 

Any argument by the applicant that the examiner has
 misconstrued the problem to be solved, and as a result has improperly relied on
 nonanalogous art, should be fully considered in light of the specification. In
 evaluating the applicant's argument, the examiner should look to the teachings of
 the specification and the inferences that would reasonably have been drawn from
 the specification by a person of ordinary skill in the art as a guide to
 understanding the problem to be solved. A prior art reference not in the same
 field of endeavor as the claimed invention must be reasonably pertinent to the
 problem to be solved in order to qualify as analogous art and be applied in an
 obviousness rejection. 

**II.** **CONSIDER SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION**

While Patent Office classification of references and the
 cross-references in the official search notes of the class definitions are some
 evidence of “nonanalogy” or “analogy” respectively, the court has found “the
 similarities and differences in structure and function of the inventions disclosed
 in the references to carry far greater weight.” *In re Ellis,* 476 F.2d 1370, 1372, 177 USPQ 526, 527 (CCPA 1973) (The structural similarities
 and functional overlap between the structural gratings shown by one reference and
 the shoe scrapers of the type shown by another reference were readily apparent,
 and therefore the arts to which the reference patents belonged were reasonably
 pertinent to the art with which appellant’s invention dealt (pedestrian floor
 gratings).). 

**III.** **ANALOGY IN THE CHEMICAL ARTS**

Examples of analogous art in the chemical arts include: *Ex parte Bland,* 3 USPQ2d 1103 (Bd. Pat App. & Inter.
 1986) (Claims were drawn to a particulate composition useful as a preservative for
 an animal foodstuff (or a method of inhibiting fungus growth in an animal
 foodstuff therewith) comprising verxite having absorbed thereon propionic acid.
 All references were concerned with absorbing biologically active materials on
 carriers, and therefore the teachings in each of the various references would have
 been pertinent to the problems in the other references and the invention at
 hand.); *Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp.,* 713 F.2d 1530, 218
 USPQ 871 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Problem confronting inventor was preventing
 electrostatic buildup in PTFE tubing caused by hydrocarbon fuel flow while
 precluding leakage of fuel. Two prior art references relied upon were in the
 rubber hose art, both referencing the problem of electrostatic buildup caused by
 fuel flow. The court found that because PTFE and rubber are used by the same hose
 manufacturers and experience the same and similar problems, a solution found for a
 problem experienced with either PTFE or rubber hosing would be looked to when
 facing a problem with the other.); *In re Mlot-Fijalkowski,* 676
 F.2d 666, 213 USPQ 713 (CCPA 1982) (Problem faced by inventor was enhancement and
 immobilization of dye penetrant indications. References which taught the use of
 dyes and finely divided developer materials to produce colored images preferably
 in, but not limited to, the duplicating paper art were properly relied upon
 because the court found that inventor's problem was one of dye chemistry, and a
 search for its solution would include the dye arts in general.). 

**IV.** **ANALOGY IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS**

Examples of analogous art in the mechanical arts include: *Stevenson v. Int'l Trade Comm.,* 612 F.2d 546, 550, 204 USPQ
 276, 280 (CCPA 1979) (“In a simple mechanical invention a broad spectrum of prior
 art must be explored and it is reasonable to permit inquiry into other areas where
 one of ordinary skill in the art would be aware that similar problems exist.”).
 See also *In re Bigio,* 381 F.3d 1320, 1325-26, 72 USPQ2d 1209,
 1211-12 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The patent application claimed a "hair brush" having a
 specific bristle configuration. The Board affirmed the examiner’s rejection of the
 claims as being obvious in view of prior art patents disclosing toothbrushes. *Id.* at 1323, 72 USPQ2d at 1210. The appellant disputed that
 the patent references constituted analogous art. On appeal, the court upheld the
 Board’s interpretation of the claim term “hair brush” to encompass any brush that
 may be used for any bodily hair, including facial hair. *Id.* at
 1323-24, 72 USPQ2d at 1211. With this claim interpretation, the court applied the
 “field of endeavor test” for analogous art and determined that the references were
 within the field of the inventor’s endeavor and hence were analogous art because
 toothbrushes are structurally similar to small brushes for hair, and a toothbrush
 could be used to brush facial hair. *Id.* at 1326, 72 USPQ2d at
 1212. 

Also see *In re Deminski,* 796 F.2d 436, 230
 USPQ 313 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Appellent's claims related to double-acting high
 pressure gas transmission line compressors in which the valves could be removed
 easily for replacement. The Board relied upon references which taught either a
 double-acting piston pump or a double-acting piston compressor. The court agreed
 that since the cited pumps and compressors have essentially the same function and
 structure, the field of endeavor includes both types of double-action piston
 devices for moving fluids.); *Pentec, Inc. v. Graphic Controls
 Corp.,* 776 F.2d 309, 227 USPQ 766 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Claims at issue
 were directed to an instrument marker pen body, the improvement comprising a pen
 arm holding means having an integrally molded hinged member for folding over
 against the pen body. Although the patent owners argued the hinge and fastener art
 was nonanalogous, the court held that the problem confronting the inventor was the
 need for a simple holding means to enable frequent, secure attachment and easy
 removal of a marker pen to and from a pen arm, and one skilled in the pen art
 trying to solve that problem would have looked to the fastener and hinge art.);
 and *Ex parte Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,* 230 USPQ 357 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1985) (A reference in the clutch art was held reasonably
 pertinent to the friction problem faced by the inventor, whose claims were
 directed to a braking material, because brakes and clutches utilize interfacing
 materials to accomplish their respective purposes.). 

**V.** **ANALOGY IN THE ELECTRICAL ARTS**

See, for example, *Medtronic, Inc. v. Cardiac
 Pacemakers,* 721 F.2d 1563, 220 USPQ 97 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Patent
 claims were drawn to a cardiac pacemaker which comprised, among other components,
 a runaway inhibitor means for preventing a pacemaker malfunction from causing
 pulses to be applied at too high a frequency. Two references disclosed circuits
 used in high power, high frequency devices which inhibited the runaway of pulses
 from a pulse source. The court held that one of ordinary skill in the pacemaker
 designer art faced with a rate-limiting problem would look to the solutions of
 others faced with rate limiting problems, and therefore the references were in an
 analogous art.). 

**VI.** **EXAMPLES OF ANALOGY IN THE DESIGN ARTS**

 of the relevant case law setting forth the general requirements for analogous art
 in design applications. 

# 2141.02 Differences Between Prior Art and Claimed Invention [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an
 application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject
 to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is
 "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject
 to **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the
 invention". See **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. Many of the
 court decisions discussed in this section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court decisions may be applicable to
 applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the
 relevant time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at
 the time of the invention.]*

Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claims at
 issue requires interpreting the claim language, and considering both the invention and
 the prior art references as a whole. See **[MPEP § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** - **[§ 2116.01](s2116.html#d0e201660)** for case
 law pertaining to claim interpretation. See also **[MPEP § 2143.03](s2143.html#d0e210501)** for examples of types of
 claim language that may raise a question as to its limiting effect. 

**I.** **THE CLAIMED INVENTION AS A WHOLE MUST BE CONSIDERED**

In determining the differences between the prior art and the claims,
 the question under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is not whether the differences themselves would have been obvious, but whether the claimed
 invention as a whole would have been obvious. *Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp.,* 713 F.2d 1530, 218 USPQ 871
 (Fed. Cir. 1983); *Schenck v. Nortron Corp.,* 713 F.2d 782, 218 USPQ
 698 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Claims were directed to a vibratory testing machine (a
 hard-bearing wheel balancer) comprising a holding structure, a base structure, and a
 supporting means which form “a single integral and gaplessly continuous piece.” *Nortron* argued the invention is just making integral what had
 been made in four bolted pieces, improperly limiting the focus to a structural
 difference from the prior art and failing to consider the invention as a whole. The
 prior art perceived a need for mechanisms to dampen resonance, whereas the inventor
 eliminated the need for dampening via the one-piece gapless support structure.
 “Because that insight was contrary to the understandings and expectations of the art,
 the structure effectuating it would not have been obvious to those skilled in the
 art.” 713 F.2d at 785, 218 USPQ at 700 (citations omitted).). 

See also *In re Hirao,* 535 F.2d 67, 190 USPQ 15
 (CCPA 1976) (Claims were directed to a three step process for preparing sweetened
 foods and drinks. The first two steps were directed to a process of producing high
 purity maltose (the sweetener), and the third was directed to adding the maltose to
 foods and drinks. The parties agreed that the first two steps were nonobvious but
 formed a known product and the third step was obvious. The Solicitor argued the
 preamble was directed to a process for preparing foods and drinks sweetened mildly
 and thus the specific method of making the high purity maltose (the first two steps
 in the claimed process) should not be given weight, analogizing with
 product-by-process claims. The court disagreed and held “due to the admitted
 unobviousness of the first two steps of the claimed combination of steps, the subject
 matter as a whole would not have been obvious to one of
 ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.” 535 F.2d at 69, 190
 USPQ at 17 (emphasis in original). The preamble only recited the purpose of the
 process and did not limit the body of the claim. Therefore, the claimed process was a
 three-step process, not the product formed by two steps of the process or the third
 step of using that product.). 

**II.** **DISTILLING THE INVENTION DOWN TO A “GIST” OR “THRUST” OF AN INVENTION
 DISREGARDS “AS A WHOLE” REQUIREMENT**

Distilling an invention down to the “gist” or “thrust” of an
 invention disregards the requirement of analyzing the subject matter “as a whole.” *W.L. Gore & Assoc., Inc. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540,
 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983), *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 851 (1984)
 (restricting consideration of the claims to a 10% per second rate of stretching of
 unsintered PTFE and disregarding other limitations resulted in treating claims as
 though they read differently than allowed); *Bausch & Lomb v.**Barnes-Hind/Hydrocurve, Inc.,* 796 F.2d 443, 447-49, 230 USPQ 416,
 419-20 (Fed. Cir. 1986), *cert. denied,* 484 U.S. 823 (1987)
 (District court focused on the “concept of forming ridgeless depressions having
 smooth rounded edges using a laser beam to vaporize the material,” but “disregarded
 express limitations that the product be an ophthalmic lens formed of a transparent
 cross-linked polymer and that the laser marks be surrounded by a smooth surface of
 unsublimated polymer.”). See also *Jones v. Hardy,* 727 F.2d 1524,
 1530, 220 USPQ 1021, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (“treating the advantage as the invention
 disregards the statutory requirement that the invention be viewed ‘as a whole’”); *Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co.,* 810 F.2d 1561, 1 USPQ2d
 1593 (Fed. Cir. 1987), *cert. denied,* 481 U.S. 1052 (1987)
 (district court improperly distilled claims down to a one word solution to a
 problem). 

**III.** **DISCOVERING SOURCE/CAUSE OF A PROBLEM IS PART OF “AS A WHOLE” INQUIRY**

“[A] patentable invention may lie in the discovery of the source of
 a problem even though the remedy may be obvious once the source of the problem is
 identified. This is part of the ‘subject matter as a whole’
 which should always be considered in determining the obviousness of an invention
 under **[35 U.S.C. §
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *In re Sponnoble,* 405 F.2d 578, 585,
 160 USPQ 237, 243 (CCPA 1969). However, “discovery of the cause of a problem . . does
 not always result in a patentable invention. . . . [A] different situation exists
 where the solution is obvious from prior art which contains the same
 solution for a similar problem.” *In re Wiseman,* 596
 F.2d 1019, 1022, 201 USPQ 658, 661 (CCPA 1979) (emphasis in original). 

In *In re Sponnoble,* the claim was directed to a
 plural compartment mixing vial wherein a center seal plug was placed between two
 compartments for temporarily isolating a liquid-containing compartment from a
 solids-containing compartment. The claim differed from the prior art in the selection
 of butyl rubber with a silicone coating as the plug material instead of natural
 rubber. The prior art recognized that leakage from the liquid to the solids
 compartment was a problem, and considered the problem to be a result of moisture
 passing around the center plug because of microscopic fissures
 inherently present in molded or blown glass. The court found the inventor discovered
 the cause of moisture transmission was through the center
 plug, and there was no teaching in the prior art which would suggest the necessity of
 selecting applicant's plug material which was more impervious to liquids than the
 natural rubber plug of the prior art. 

In *In re Wiseman,* 596 F.2d at 1022, 201 USPQ at
 661, claims directed to grooved carbon disc brakes wherein the grooves were provided
 to vent steam or vapor during a braking action to minimize fading of the brakes were
 rejected as obvious over a reference showing carbon disc brakes without grooves in
 combination with a reference showing grooves in noncarbon disc brakes for the purpose
 of cooling the faces of the braking members and eliminating dust, thereby reducing
 fading of the brakes. The court affirmed the rejection, holding that even if the
 inventor discovered the cause of a problem, the solution would have been obvious from
 the prior art which contained the same solution (inserting grooves in disc brakes)
 for a similar problem. 

**IV.** **APPLICANTS ALLEGING DISCOVERY OF A SOURCE OF A PROBLEM MUST PROVIDE
 SUBSTANTIATING EVIDENCE**

Applicants who allege the inventor discovered the source of a
 problem must provide evidence substantiating the allegation, either by way of
 affidavits or declarations, or by way of a clear and persuasive assertion in the
 specification. *In re Wiseman,* 596 F.2d 1019, 201 USPQ 658 (CCPA
 1979) (unsubstantiated statement of counsel was insufficient to show appellants
 discovered source of the problem); *In re Kaslow,* 707 F.2d 1366,
 217 USPQ 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Claims were directed to a method for redeeming
 merchandising coupons which contain a UPC “5-by-5” bar code wherein, among other
 steps, the memory at each supermarket would identify coupons by manufacturer and
 transmit the data to a central computer to provide an audit, thereby eliminating the
 need for clearinghouses and preventing retailer fraud. In challenging the propriety
 of an obviousness rejection, appellant argued he discovered the source of a problem
 (retailer fraud and manual clearinghouse operations) and its solution. The court
 found appellant’s specification did not support the argument that he discovered the
 source of the problem with respect to retailer fraud, and that the claimed invention
 failed to solve the problem of manual clearinghouse operations.). 

**V.** **DISCLOSED INHERENT PROPERTIES ARE PART OF “AS A WHOLE” INQUIRY**

“In determining whether the invention as a whole would have been
 obvious under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, we must first delineate the invention as a whole.
 In delineating the invention as a whole, we look not only to the subject matter which
 is literally recited in the claim in question... but also to those properties of the
 subject matter which are inherent in the subject matter *and* are
 disclosed in the specification. . . Just as we look to a chemical and its properties
 when we examine the obviousness of a composition of matter claim, it is this
 invention *as a whole,* and not some part of it, which must be
 obvious under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *In re Antonie,* 559 F.2d 618,
 620, 195 USPQ 6, 8 (CCPA 1977) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted) (The
 claimed wastewater treatment device had a tank volume to contactor area of 0.12
 gal./sq. ft. The court found the invention as a whole was the ratio of 0.12 and its
 inherent property that the claimed devices maximized treatment capacity regardless of
 other variables in the devices. The prior art did not recognize that treatment
 capacity was a function of the tank volume to contactor ratio, and therefore the
 parameter optimized was not recognized in the art to be a result-effective
 variable.). Note, however, that after *KSR,* the presence of a known
 result-effective variable would be one, but not necessarily the only, motivation for
 a person of ordinary skill in the art to experiment to reach another workable product
 or process. See **[MPEP §
 2144.05](s2144.html#d0e211255)**, subsection II.B. See also *In re
 Papesch,* 315 F.2d 381, 391, 137 USPQ 43, 51 (CCPA 1963) (“From the
 standpoint of patent law, a compound and all its properties are inseparable.”). 

Obviousness cannot be predicated on what is not known at the
 relevant time, even if the inherency of a certain feature is later established. See *In re Rijckaert,* 9 F.3d 1531, 28 USPQ2d 1955 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
 See **[MPEP §
 2112](s2112.html#d0e201036)** for the requirements of rejections based on
 inherency. 

**VI.** **PRIOR ART MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ITS ENTIRETY, INCLUDING DISCLOSURES THAT TEACH
 AWAY FROM THE CLAIMS**

A prior art reference must be considered in its entirety, i.e., as a whole, including portions that would lead away from the
 claimed invention. *W.L. Gore & Assoc., Inc. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983), *cert. denied,* 469
 U.S. 851 (1984) (Claims were directed to a process of producing a porous article by
 expanding shaped, unsintered, highly crystalline poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) by
 stretching said PTFE at a 10% per second rate to more than five times the original
 length. The prior art teachings with regard to unsintered PTFE indicated the material
 does not respond to conventional plastics processing, and the material should be
 stretched slowly. A reference teaching rapid stretching of conventional plastic
 polypropylene with reduced crystallinity combined with a reference teaching
 stretching unsintered PTFE would not suggest rapid stretching of highly crystalline
 PTFE, in light of the disclosures in the art that teach away from the invention,
 i.e., that the conventional polypropylene should have reduced crystallinity before
 stretching, and that PTFE should be stretched slowly). *Allied Erecting v.
 Genesis Attachments,* 825 F.3d 1373, 1381, 119 USPQ2d 1132, 1138 (Fed.
 Cir. 2016) (“Although modification of the movable blades may impede the quick change
 functionality disclosed by Caterpillar, ‘[a] given course of action often has
 simultaneous advantages and disadvantages, and this does not necessarily obviate
 motivation to combine.’” (quoting *Medichem, S.A. v. Rolabo, S.L.,* 437 F.3d 1157, 1165, 77 USPQ2d 1865, 1870 (Fed Cir. 2006) (citation omitted))). 

However, “the prior art’s mere disclosure of more than one
 alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives
 because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the
 solution claimed….” *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73 USPQ2d
 1141, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See also **[MPEP § 2123](s2123.html#d0e202024)**. 

# 2141.03 Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art [R-01.2024]

 application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject
 to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is
 "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject
 to **[pre-AIA 35

**I.** **FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING LEVEL OF ORDINARY SKILL**

The person of ordinary skill in the art is a hypothetical person who
 is presumed to have known the relevant art at the relevant time. Factors that may be
 considered in determining the level of ordinary skill in the art may include: (A)
 “type of problems encountered in the art;” (B) “prior art solutions to those
 problems;” (C) “rapidity with which innovations are made;” (D) “sophistication of the
 technology; and” (E) “educational level of active workers in the field. In a given
 case, every factor may not be present, and one or more factors may predominate.” *In re GPAC,* 57 F.3d 1573, 1579, 35 USPQ2d 1116, 1121 (Fed. Cir.
 1995); *Custom Accessories, Inc. v. Jeffrey-Allan Indus., Inc.,* 807
 F.2d 955, 962, 1 USPQ2d 1196, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1986); *Environmental Designs,
 Ltd. V. Union Oil Co.,* 713 F.2d 693, 696, 218 USPQ 865, 868 (Fed. Cir.
 1983). 

“A person of ordinary skill in the art is also a person of ordinary
 creativity, not an automaton.” *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550
 U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007). “[I]n many cases a person of ordinary
 skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a
 puzzle.”  *Id.* at 420, 82 USPQ2d 1397. Office personnel may also
 take into account “the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill
 in the art would employ.” *Id.* at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. 

The level of disclosure in the specification of the
 application under examination or in relevant references may also be informative of
 the knowledge and skills of a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, if
 the specification is entirely silent on how a certain step or function is achieved,
 that silence may suggest that figuring out how to achieve that step or function is
 within the ordinary skill in the art, provided that the specification complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**. *Uber Techs., Inc. v. X One, Inc.,* 957
 F.3d 1334, 1339, 2020 USPQ2d 10476 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (“The specification of the '593
 patent is entirely silent on how to transmit user locations and maps from a server to
 a user's mobile device, suggesting that a person of ordinary skill in the art was
 more than capable of selecting between the known methods of accomplishing this. The
 '593 patent confirms that its invention, including any necessary plotting, ‘utilizes
 existing platforms and infrastructure’ and does not ‘require development of new cell
 phone or PDA technology, nor do[es it] require development of new cellular
 communication infrastructure.’") 

The “hypothetical ‘person having ordinary skill in the art’ to which
 the claimed subject matter pertains would, of necessity have the capability of
 understanding the scientific and engineering principles applicable to the pertinent
 art.” *Ex parte Hiyamizu,* 10 USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1988) (The Board disagreed with the examiner’s definition of one of ordinary
 skill in the art (a doctorate level engineer or scientist working at least 40 hours
 per week in semiconductor research or development), finding that the hypothetical
 person is not definable by way of credentials, and that the evidence in the
 application did not support the conclusion that such a person would require a
 doctorate or equivalent knowledge in science or engineering.). 

References which are not prior art may be relied upon to demonstrate
 the level of ordinary skill in the art at or around the relevant time. See *In re Merck & Co., Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 1098, 231 USPQ 375,
 380 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (“Evidence of contemporaneous invention is probative of ‘the
 level of knowledge in the art at the time the invention was made.’” (citing *In re Farrenkopf,* 713 F.2d 714, 720, 219 USPQ 1, 6 (Fed. Cir.
 1983))); *Ecolochem, Inc. v. S. California Edison Co.,* 227 F.3d
 1361, 1379, 56 USPQ2d 1065, 1079 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“The fact of near-simultaneous
 invention, though not determinative of statutory obviousness, is strong evidence of
 what constitutes the level of ordinary skill in the art.” (quoting *The Int’l
 Glass Co. v. United States,* 408 F.2d 395, 405, 159 USPQ 434, 442 (Ct.
 Cl. 1969))). See also *Thomas & Betts Corp. v. Litton Sys.,
 Inc.,* 720 F.2d 1572, 1580-81, 220 USPQ 1, 7 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (“Thus, the
 [unpublished internal materials], though not technically prior art, were, in effect,
 properly used as indicators of the level of ordinary skill in the art to which the
 invention pertained.”). 

Moreover, references not available as prior art may
 be relevant to establishing “a motivation to combine which is implicit in the
 knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.” *Nat'l Steel Car, Ltd. v.
 Can. Pac. Ry., Ltd.,* 357 F.3d 1319, 1337-38, 69 USPQ2d 1641, 1656 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) (holding that a drawing made by an engineer that was not prior art can,
 nonetheless, “... be used to demonstrate a motivation to combine implicit in the
 knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.”). 

**II.** **SPECIFYING A PARTICULAR LEVEL OF SKILL IS NOT NECESSARY WHERE THE PRIOR ART
 ITSELF REFLECTS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL**

If the only facts of record pertaining to the level of skill in the
 art are found within the prior art of record, the court has held that an invention
 may be held to have been obvious without a specific finding of a particular level of
 skill where the prior art itself reflects an appropriate level. *Chore-Time
 Equipment, Inc. v. Cumberland Corp.,* 713 F.2d 774, 218 USPQ 673 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983). See also *Okajima v. Bourdeau,* 261 F.3d 1350, 1355, 59
 USPQ2d 1795, 1797 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 

**III.** **ASCERTAINING LEVEL OF ORDINARY SKILL IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN
 OBJECTIVITY**

“The importance of resolving the level of ordinary skill in the art
 lies in the necessity of maintaining objectivity in the obviousness inquiry.” *Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Nu-Star, Inc.,* 950 F.2d 714, 718, 21 USPQ2d
 1053, 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The examiner must ascertain what would have been obvious
 as of the relevant time to one of ordinary skill in the art, and not to the inventor,
 a judge, a layman, those skilled in remote arts, or to geniuses in the art at hand. *Environmental Designs, Ltd. v. Union Oil Co.,* 713 F.2d 693, 218
 USPQ 865 (Fed. Cir. 1983), *cert. denied,* 464 U.S. 1043 (1984).

# 2142 Legal Concept of *Prima Facie* Obviousness [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: Many of the court decisions
 discussed in this section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court decisions may be applicable to applications and
 patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the relevant
 time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at the time of
 the invention.]*

“During patent examination and reexamination, the concept of
 prima facie obviousness establishes the framework for the obviousness determination and the
 burdens the parties face. Under this framework, the patent examiner must first set forth a
 prima facie case, supported by evidence, showing why the claims at issue would have been
 obvious in light of the prior art. Once the examiner sets out this prima facie case, the
 burden shifts to the patentee to provide evidence, in the prior art or beyond it, or
 argument sufficient to rebut the examiner's evidence. The examiner then reaches the final
 determination on obviousness by weighing the evidence establishing the prima facie case
 with the rebuttal evidence.” *ACCO Brands Corp. v. Fellowes, Inc.,* 813
 F.3d 1361, 1365–66, 117 USPQ2d 1951, 1553-54 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). 

The legal concept of *prima facie* obviousness is a
 procedural tool of examination which applies broadly to all arts. It allocates who has the
 burden of going forward with production of evidence or arguments in each step of the
 examination process. See *In re Rinehart,* 531 F.2d 1048, 189 USPQ 143
 (CCPA 1976); *In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972); *In re Saunders,* 444 F.2d 599, 170 USPQ 213 (CCPA 1971); *In
 re Tiffin,* 443 F.2d 394, 170 USPQ 88 (CCPA 1971), *amended,* 448 F.2d 791, 171 USPQ 294 (CCPA 1971); *In re Warner,* 379 F.2d 1011, 154
 USPQ 173 (CCPA 1967), *cert. denied,* 389 U.S. 1057 (1968). The examiner
 bears the initial burden of using facts and reasoning to establish a *prima
 facie* conclusion of obviousness. If the examiner does not produce a *prima facie* case, the applicant is under no obligation to submit
 evidence or arguments to show nonobviousness. If, however, the examiner does produce a *prima facie* case, the burden of coming forward with evidence or
 arguments shifts to the applicant who may submit additional evidence of nonobviousness,
 such as comparative test data showing that the claimed invention possesses properties not
 expected by the prior art, or rebuttal arguments. The decision of whether to submit
 evidence after a rejection should be influenced by the goals of compact prosecution, which
 encourages the early submission of such evidence. It is also noted that evidence submitted
 after final rejection may be denied entry into the record. 

To reach a proper determination under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, the examiner must step backward in time and into the shoes worn
 by the hypothetical “person of ordinary skill in the art”. That time is “before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention” for **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** or “at the time the invention was made” for **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. In view of all factual information, the examiner must then make a
 determination whether the claimed invention “as a whole” would have been obvious at that
 time to a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art. Knowledge of applicant’s
 disclosure must be put aside in reaching this determination, yet kept in mind in order to
 determine the “differences,” conduct the search, and evaluate the “subject matter as a
 whole” of the invention. The tendency to resort to “hindsight” based upon applicant's
 disclosure is often difficult to avoid due to the very nature of the examination process.
 However, impermissible hindsight must be avoided and the legal conclusion must be reached
 on the basis of the facts gleaned from the prior art. 

**[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** authorizes a rejection where, to meet the claim, it is
 necessary to modify a single reference or to combine it with one or more other references.
 After indicating that the rejection is under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner should set
 forth in the Office action: 

- (A) the relevant teachings of the prior art relied upon, preferably with
 reference to the relevant column or page number(s) and line number(s) where
 appropriate,
- (B) the difference or differences in the claim over the applied
 reference(s),
- (C) the proposed modification of the applied reference(s) necessary to
 arrive at the claimed subject matter, and
- (D) an explanation as to why the claimed invention would have been
 obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the relevant time.


“To support the conclusion that the claimed invention is directed to
 obvious subject matter, either the references must expressly or impliedly suggest the
 claimed invention or the examiner must present a convincing line of reasoning as to why the
 artisan would have found the claimed invention to have been obvious in light of the
 teachings of the references.” *Ex parte Clapp,* 227 USPQ 972, 973 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1985). 

Where a reference is relied on to support a rejection, whether or not in a
 minor capacity, that reference should be positively included in the statement of the
 rejection. See *In re Hoch,* 428 F.2d 1341, 1342 n.3 166 USPQ 406, 407 n.3
 (CCPA 1970). 

It is important for an examiner to properly communicate the basis for a
 rejection so that the issues can be identified early and the applicant can be given fair
 opportunity to reply. Furthermore, if an initially rejected application issues as a patent,
 the rationale behind an earlier rejection may be important in interpreting the scope of the
 patent claims. Since issued patents are presumed valid (**[35 U.S.C. 282](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845)**) and constitute a
 property right (**[35 U.S.C.
 261](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305441)**), the written record must be clear as to the basis for the grant.
 Since patent examiners cannot normally be compelled to testify in legal proceedings
 regarding their mental processes (see **[MPEP § 1701.01](s1701.html#d0e162459)**), it is important that the
 written record clearly explain the rationale for decisions made during prosecution of the
 application.

 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. 

**ESTABLISHING A *PRIMA FACIE* CASE OF OBVIOUSNESS**

The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is
 the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been
 obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550
 U.S. 398, 418, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007) noted that the analysis supporting a
 rejection under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. The Federal Circuit has stated
 that "rejections on obviousness cannot be sustained with mere conclusory statements;
 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to
 support the legal conclusion of obviousness.” *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d
 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also *KSR,* 550
 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (quoting Federal Circuit's statement in *Kahn* with approval). 

It remains true that “[t]he determination of obviousness is dependent
 on the facts of each case.” *Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc.,* 550
 F.3d 1075, 1089, 89 USPQ2d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing *Graham,* 383 U.S. at 17-18, 148 USPQ 459, 467 (1966)). If the
 examiner determines there is factual support for rejecting the claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner must then consider any evidence supporting the
 patentability of the claimed invention, such as any evidence in the specification or any
 other evidence submitted by the applicant. The ultimate determination of patentability
 is based on the entire record, by a preponderance of evidence, with due consideration to
 the persuasiveness of any arguments and any evidence properly made of record. *In re Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The
 legal standard of “a preponderance of evidence” requires the evidence to be more
 convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it. With regard to
 rejections under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner must provide evidence which as a whole
 shows that the legal determination sought to be proved (i.e., a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness has been established) is more probable than
 not. 

When an applicant properly submits evidence, whether in the
 specification as originally filed, prior to a rejection, or in reply to a rejection, the
 examiner must consider the patentability of the claims in light of the evidence. The
 decision on patentability must be made based upon consideration of all the evidence,
 including the evidence submitted by the examiner and the evidence submitted by the
 applicant. A decision to make or maintain a rejection in the face of all the evidence
 must show that it was based on the totality of the evidence. Facts established by
 rebuttal evidence must be evaluated along with the facts on which the conclusion of
 obviousness was reached, not against the conclusion itself. *In re Eli Lilly
 & Co.,* 902 F.2d 943, 14 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 1990). 

See *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 223 USPQ 785
 (Fed. Cir. 1984) for a discussion of the proper roles of the examiner’s *prima
 facie* case and applicant’s rebuttal evidence in the final determination of
 obviousness.

# 2143 Examples of Basic Requirements of a *Prima Facie* Case of Obviousness [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an application
 is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject to the first
 inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is "before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the invention". See **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. Many of the court decisions discussed in this
 section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court
 decisions may be applicable to applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the relevant time is before the effective filing date of
 the claimed invention and not at the time of the invention.]*

The Supreme Court in *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 415-421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1395-97 (2007) identified a number of rationales to
 support a conclusion of obviousness which are consistent with the proper “functional
 approach” to the determination of obviousness as laid down in *Graham*.
 The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is the clear articulation
 of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. In *Ball Aerosol v. Ltd.
 Brands,* 555 F.3d 984, 89 USPQ2d 1870 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Federal Circuit
 offered additional instruction as to the need for an explicit analysis. The Federal Circuit
 explained that the Supreme Court’s requirement for an explicit analysis does not require
 record evidence of an explicit teaching of a motivation to combine in the prior art. 

“[T]he analysis that “should be made explicit” refers not
 to the teachings in the prior art of a motivation to combine, but to the court’s analysis.
 . . . Under the flexible inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court, the district court
 therefore erred by failing to take account of ‘the inferences and creative steps,’ or even
 routine steps, that an inventor would employ and by failing to find a motivation to combine
 related pieces from the prior art.” *Ball Aerosol,* 555 F.3d at 993, 89
 USPQ2d at 1877. 

The Federal Circuit’s directive in *Ball
 Aerosol* was addressed to a lower court, but it applies to Office personnel as
 well. When setting forth a rejection, Office personnel are to continue to make appropriate
 findings of fact as explained in **[MPEP § 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)** and **[§ 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, and must provide
 a reasoned explanation as to why the invention as claimed would have been obvious to a
 person of ordinary skill in the art at the relevant time. This requirement for explanation
 remains even in situations in which Office personnel may properly rely on common sense or
 ordinary ingenuity. *In re Van Os,* 844 F.3d 1359, 1361, 121 USPQ2d 1209,
 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (“Absent some articulated rationale, a finding that a combination of
 prior art would have been ‘common sense’ or ‘intuitive’ is no different than merely stating
 the combination ‘would have been obvious.’”). 

**I.** **EXAMPLES OF RATIONALES**

Examples of rationales that may support a conclusion of obviousness
 include: 

- (A) Combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield
 predictable results;
- (B) Simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain
 predictable results;
- (C) Use of known technique to improve similar devices (methods, or
 products) in the same way;
- (D) Applying a known technique to a known device (method, or product)
 ready for improvement to yield predictable results;
- (E) “Obvious to try” – choosing from a finite number of identified,
 predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success;
- (F) Known work in one field of endeavor may prompt variations of it
 for use in either the same field or a different one based on design incentives or
 other market forces if the variations are predictable to one of ordinary skill in
 the art;
- (G) Some teaching, suggestion, or motivation in the prior art that
 would have led one of ordinary skill to modify the prior art reference or to
 combine prior art reference teachings to arrive at the claimed invention.


Note that the list of rationales provided is not intended to be an
 all-inclusive list. Other rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness may be
 relied upon by Office personnel. Any rationale employed must provide a link between the
 factual findings and the legal conclusion of obviousness. 

It is important for Office personnel to recognize that
 when they do choose to formulate an obviousness rejection using one of the rationales
 suggested by the Supreme Court in *KSR* and discussed herein, they are
 to adhere to the guidance provided regarding the necessary factual findings. It remains
 Office policy that appropriate factual findings are required in order to apply the
 enumerated rationales properly. 

The subsections below include discussions of each rationale along with
 examples illustrating how the cited rationales may be used to support a finding of
 obviousness. Some examples use the facts of pre-*KSR* cases to show how
 the rationales suggested by the Court in *KSR* may be used to support a
 finding of obviousness. The cases cited (from which the facts were derived) may not
 necessarily stand for the proposition that the particular rationale is the basis for the
 court’s holding of obviousness, but they do illustrate consistency of past decisions
 with the lines of reasoning laid out in *KSR.* Other examples are
 post-*KSR* decisions that show how the Federal Circuit has applied
 the principles of *KSR.* Cases are included that illustrate findings of
 obviousness as well as nonobviousness. Note that, in some instances, a single case is
 used in different subsections to illustrate the use of more than one rationale to
 support a finding of obviousness. It will often be the case that, once the *Graham* inquiries have been satisfactorily resolved, a conclusion
 of obviousness may be supported by more than one line of reasoning. 

***A.******Combining Prior Art Elements According to Known Methods To Yield
 Predictable Results***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that the prior art included each element claimed,
 although not necessarily in a single prior art reference, with the only
 difference between the claimed invention and the prior art being the lack of
 actual combination of the elements in a single prior art reference;
- (2) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
 combined the elements as claimed by known methods, and that in combination,
 each element merely performs the same function as it does separately;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
 recognized that the results of the combination were predictable; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that all the claimed elements were known in the prior art and one
 skilled in the art could have combined the elements as claimed by known methods with
 no change in their respective functions, and the combination yielded nothing more
 than predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395; *B/E Aerospace, Inc. v. C&D Zodiac,
 Inc.,* 962 F.3d 1373, 1379, 2020 USPQ2d 10706 (Fed. Cir. 2020); *Sakraida v. AG Pro, Inc.,* 425 U.S. 273, 282, 189 USPQ 449, 453

 “[I]t can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of
 ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed
 new invention does.” *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. If
 any of these findings cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a
 conclusion that the claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
 art. 

**Example 1:**

The claimed invention in *Anderson’s-Black Rock, Inc. v.
 Pavement Salvage Co.,* 396 U.S. 57, 163 USPQ 673 (1969) was a paving
 machine which combined several well-known elements onto a single chassis. Standard
 prior art paving machines typically combined equipment for spreading and shaping
 asphalt onto a single chassis. The patent claim included the well-known element of
 a radiant-heat burner attached to the side of the paver for the purpose of
 preventing cold joints during continuous strip paving. The prior art used radiant
 heat for softening the asphalt to make patches, but did not use radiant heat
 burners to achieve continuous strip paving. All of the component parts were known
 in the prior art. The only difference was the combination of the “old elements”
 into a single device by mounting them on a single chassis. The Court found that
 the operation of the heater was in no way dependent on the operation of the other
 equipment, and that a separate heater could also be used in conjunction with a
 standard paving machine to achieve the same results. The Court concluded that
 “[t]he convenience of putting the burner together with the other elements in one
 machine, though perhaps a matter of great convenience, did not produce a ‘new’ or
 ‘different function’” and that to those skilled in the art the use of the old
 elements in combination would have been obvious. *Id.* at 60, 163
 USPQ at 674. 

Note that combining known prior art elements is not sufficient to
 render the claimed invention obvious if the results would not have been
 predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art.  *United States v.
 Adams,* 383 U.S. 39, 51-52, 148 USPQ 479, 483-84 (1966). In *Adams,* the claimed invention was to a battery with one
 magnesium electrode and one cuprous chloride electrode that could be stored dry
 and activated by the addition of plain water or salt water. Although magnesium and
 cuprous chloride were individually known battery components, the Court concluded
 that the claimed battery was nonobvious. The Court stated that “[d]espite the fact
 that each of the elements of the Adams battery was well known in the prior art, to
 combine them as did Adams required that a person reasonably skilled in the prior
 art must ignore” the teaching away of the prior art that such batteries were
 impractical and that water-activated batteries were successful only when combined
 with electrolytes detrimental to the use of magnesium electrodes. *Id.* at 42-43, 50-52, 148 USPQ at 480, 483. “[W]hen the prior
 art teaches away from combining certain known elements, discovery of successful
 means of combining them is more likely to be nonobvious.”*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. 

**Example 2:**

The claimed invention in *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance
 Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) was directed to a
 system which employs a screw anchor for underpinning
 existing foundations and a metal bracket to transfer the
 building load onto the screw anchor. The prior art (Fuller) used screw anchors for
 underpinning existing structural foundations. Fuller used a concrete haunch to
 transfer the load of the foundation to the screw anchor. The prior art (Gregory)
 used a push pier for underpinning existing structural foundations. Gregory taught
 a method of transferring load using a bracket, wherein a metal bracket transfers
 the foundation load to the push pier. The pier is driven into the ground to
 support the load. Neither reference showed the two elements of the claimed
 invention – screw anchor and metal bracket – used together. The court found that
 “artisans knew that a foundation underpinning system requires a means of
 connecting the foundation to the load-bearing member.” *Id.* at
 1276, 69 USPQ2d at 1691. 

The nature of the problem to be solved – underpinning unstable
 foundations – as well as the need to connect the member to the foundation to
 accomplish this goal, would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to choose an
 appropriate load bearing member and a compatible attachment. Therefore, it would
 have been obvious to use a metal bracket (as shown in Gregory) in combination with
 the screw anchor (as shown in Fuller) to underpin unstable foundations. 

**Example 3:**

The case of *In re Omeprazole Patent
 Litigation,* 536 F.3d 1361, 87 USPQ2d 1865 (Fed. Cir. 2008), is one in
 which the claims in question were found to be nonobvious in the context of an
 argument to combine prior art elements. The invention involved applying enteric
 coatings to a drug in pill form for the purpose of ensuring that the drug did not
 disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action. The drug at issue was
 omeprazole, the generic name for gastric acid inhibitor marketed as
 Prilosec®. The claimed formulation included two
 layers of coatings over the active ingredient. 

The district court found that Astra’s patent in
 suit was infringed by defendants Apotex and Impax. The district court rejected
 Apotex’s defense that the patents were invalid for obviousness. Apotex had argued
 that the claimed invention was obvious because coated omeprazole tablets were
 known from a prior art reference, and because secondary subcoatings in
 pharmaceutical preparations generally were also known. There was no evidence of
 unpredictability associated with applying two different enteric coatings to
 omeprazole. However, Astra’s reason for applying an intervening subcoating between
 the prior art coating and omeprazole had been that the prior art coating was
 actually interacting with omeprazole, thereby contributing to undesirable
 degradation of the active ingredient. This degradation of omeprazole by
 interaction with the prior art coating had not been recognized in the prior art.
 Therefore, the district court reasoned that based on the evidence available, a
 person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to include a
 subcoating in an omeprazole pill formulation. 

The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s
 decision that the claimed invention was not obvious. Even though subcoatings for
 enteric drug formulation were known, and there was no evidence of undue technical
 hurdles or lack of a reasonable expectation of success, the formulation was
 nevertheless not obvious because the flaws in the prior art formulation that had
 prompted the modification had not been recognized. Thus there would have been no
 reason to modify the initial formulation, even though the modification could have
 been done. Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art likely would have
 chosen a different modification even if they had recognized the problem. 

Office personnel should note that in this case the
 modification of the prior art that had been presented as an argument for
 obviousness was an extra process step that added an additional component to a
 known, successfully marketed formulation. The proposed modification thus amounted
 to extra work and greater expense for no apparent reason. This is not the same as
 combining known prior art elements A and B when each would have been expected to
 contribute its own known properties to the final product. In the *Omeprazole* case, in view of the expectations of those of
 ordinary skill in the art, adding the subcoating would not have been expected to
 confer any particular desirable property on the final product. Rather, the final
 product obtained according to the proposed modifications would merely have been
 expected to have the same functional properties as the prior art product. 

The *Omeprazole* case can also be
 analyzed in view of the discovery of a previously unknown problem by the patentee.
 If the adverse interaction between active agent and coating had been known, it
 might well have been obvious to use a subcoating. However, since the problem had
 not been previously known, there would have been no reason to incur additional
 time and expense to add another layer, even though the addition would have been
 technologically possible. This is true because the prior art of record failed to
 mention any stability problem, despite the acknowledgment during testimony at
 trial that there was a known theoretical reason that omeprazole might be subject
 to degradation in the presence of the known coating material. 

**Example 4:**

The case of *Crocs, Inc. v. U.S. Int'l
 Trade Comm'n,* 598 F.3d 1294, 93 USPQ 1777 (Fed. Cir. 2010), is a
 decision in which the claimed foam footwear was held by the Federal Circuit to be
 nonobvious over a combination of prior art references. 

The claims involved in the obviousness issue were
 from Crocs’ U.S. Patent No. 6,993,858, and were drawn to footwear in which a
 one-piece molded foam base section formed the top of the shoe (the upper) and the
 sole. A strap also made of foam was attached to the foot opening of the upper,
 such that the strap could provide support to the Achilles portion of the wearer’s
 foot. The strap was attached via connectors that allowed it to be in contact with
 the base section, and to pivot relative to the base section. Because both the base
 portion and the strap were made of foam, friction between the strap and the base
 section allowed the strap to maintain its position after pivoting. In other words,
 the foam strap did not fall under the force of gravity to a position adjacent to
 the heel of the base section. 

The International Trade Commission (ITC) determined
 that the claims were obvious over the combination of two pieces of prior art. The
 first was the Aqua Clog, which was a shoe that corresponded to the base section of
 the footwear of the ‘858 patent. The second was the Aguerre patent, which taught
 heel straps made of elastic or another flexible material. In the ITC’s view, the
 claimed invention was obvious because the prior art Aqua Clog differed from the
 claimed invention only as to the presence of the strap, and a suitable strap was
 taught by Aguerre. 

The Federal Circuit disagreed. The Federal Circuit
 stated that the prior art did not teach foam heel straps, or that a foam heel
 strap should be placed in contact with a foam base. The Federal Circuit pointed
 out that the prior art actually counseled against using foam as a material for the
 heel strap of a shoe. 
> The record shows that the prior art would
> actually discourage and teach away from the use of foam straps. An ordinary
> artisan in this field would not add a foam strap to the foam Aqua Clog because
> foam was likely to stretch and deform, in addition to causing discomfort for a
> wearer. The prior art depicts foam as unsuitable for straps.

*Id.* at 1309, 93 USPQ2d at 1787-88. 

The Federal Circuit continued, stating that even if
 – contrary to fact – the claimed invention had been a combination of elements that
 were known in the prior art, the claims still would have been nonobvious. There
 was testimony in the record that the loose fit of the heel strap made the shoe
 more comfortable for the wearer than prior art shoes in which the heel strap was
 constantly in contact with the wearer’s foot. In the claimed footwear, the foam
 heel strap contacted the wearer’s foot only when needed to help reposition the
 foot properly in the shoe, thus reducing wearer discomfort that could arise from
 constant contact. This desirable feature was a result of the friction between the
 base section and the strap that kept the strap in place behind the Achilles
 portion of the wearer’s foot. The Federal Circuit pointed out that this
 combination “yielded more than predictable results.” *Id.* at
 1310, 93 USPQ2d at 1788. Aguerre had taught that friction between the base section
 and the strap was a problem rather than an advantage, and had suggested the use of
 nylon washers to reduce friction. Thus the Federal Circuit stated that even if all
 elements of the claimed invention had been taught by the prior art, the claims
 would not have been obvious because the combination yielded more than predictable
 results. 

The Federal Circuit’s discussion in Crocs serves as
 a reminder to Office personnel that merely pointing to the presence of all claim
 elements in the prior art is not a complete statement of a rejection for
 obviousness. In accordance with **[MPEP § 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, subsection I.A.(3),
 a proper rejection based on the rationale that the claimed invention is a
 combination of prior art elements also includes a finding that results flowing
 from the combination would have been predictable to a person of ordinary skill in
 the art. **[MPEP §
 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, subsection I.A.(3). If results would not have been
 predictable, Office personnel should not enter an obviousness rejection using the
 combination of prior art elements rationale, and should withdraw such a rejection
 if it has been made. 

**Example 5:**

*Sundance, Inc. v. DeMonte Fabricating Ltd.,* 550 F.3d 1356, 89
 USPQ2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 2008), involved a segmented and mechanized cover for
 trucks, swimming pools, or other structures. The claim was found to be obvious
 over the prior art applied. 

A first prior art reference taught that a reason
 for making a segmented cover was ease of repair, in that a single damaged segment
 could be readily removed and replaced when necessary. A second prior art reference
 taught the advantages of a mechanized cover for ease of opening. The Federal
 Circuit noted that the segmentation aspect of the first reference and the
 mechanization function of the second perform in the same way after combination as
 they had before. The Federal Circuit further observed that a person of ordinary
 skill in the art would have expected that adding replaceable segments as taught by
 the first reference to the mechanized cover of the other would result in a cover
 that maintained the advantageous properties of both of the prior art covers. 

Thus, the Sundance case points out that a hallmark
 of a proper obviousness rejection based on combining known prior art elements is
 that one of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably have expected the elements
 to maintain their respective properties or functions after they have been
 combined. 

**Example 6:**

In the case of *Ecolab, Inc. v. FMC
 Corp.,* 569 F.3d 1335, 91 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2009), an “apparent
 reason to combine” in conjunction with the technical ability to optimize led to
 the conclusion that the claimed invention would have been obvious. 

The invention in question was a method of treating
 meat to reduce the incidence of pathogens, by spraying the meat with an
 antibacterial solution under specified conditions. The parties did not dispute
 that a single prior art reference had taught all of the elements of the claimed
 invention, except for the pressure limitation of “at least 50 psi.” 

FMC had argued at the district court that the
 claimed invention would have been obvious in view of the first prior art reference
 mentioned above in view of a second reference that had taught the advantages of
 spray-treating at pressures of 20 to 150 psi when treating meat with a different
 antibacterial agent. The district court did not find FMC’s argument to be
 convincing, and denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law that the claim
 was obvious. 

Disagreeing with the district court, the Federal
 Circuit stated that “there was an apparent reason to combine these known elements
 – namely to increase contact between the [antibacterial solution] and the bacteria
 on the meat surface and to use the pressure to wash additional bacteria off the
 meat surface.” *Id.* at 1350, 91 USPQ2d at 1234. The Federal
 Circuit explained that because the second reference had taught “using high
 pressure to improve the effectiveness of an antimicrobial solution when sprayed
 onto meat, and because an ordinarily skilled artisan would have recognized the
 reasons for applying [the claimed antibacterial solution] using high pressure and
 would have known how to do so, Ecolab’s claims combining high pressure with other
 limitations disclosed in FMC’s patent are invalid as obvious.” *Id.*

When considering the question of obviousness,
 Office personnel should keep in mind the capabilities of a person of ordinary
 skill. In *Ecolab,* the Federal Circuit stated: 
> Ecolab’s expert admitted that one skilled in the
> art would know how to adjust application parameters to determine the optimum
> parameters for a particular solution. The question then is whether it would
> have been obvious to combine the high pressure parameter disclosed in the
> Bender patent with the PAA methods disclosed in FMC’s ’676 patent. The answer
> is yes. *Id.*

If optimization of the application parameters had
 not been within the level of ordinary skill in the art, the outcome of the *Ecolab* case may well have been different. 

**Example 7:**

In the case of *Wyers v. Master Lock
 Co.,* 616 F.3d 1231, 95 USPQ2d 1525 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the Federal
 Circuit held that the claimed barbell-shaped hitch pin locks used to secure
 trailers to vehicles were obvious. 

The court discussed two different sets of claims in *Wyers,* both drawn to improvements over the prior art hitch
 pin locks. The first improvement was a removable sleeve that could be placed over
 the shank of the hitch pin lock so that the same lock could be used with towing
 apertures of varying sizes. The second improvement was an external flat flange
 seal adapted to protect the internal lock mechanism from contaminants. Wyers had
 admitted that each of several prior art references taught every element of the
 claimed inventions except for the removable sleeve and the external covering.
 Master Lock had argued that these references, in combination with additional
 references teaching the missing elements, would have rendered the claims obvious.
 The court first addressed the question of whether the additional references relied
 on by Master Lock were analogous prior art. As to the reference teaching the
 sleeve improvement, the court concluded that it dealt specifically with using a
 vehicle to tow a trailer, and was therefore in the same field of endeavor as
 Wyers’ sleeve improvement. The reference teaching the sealing improvement dealt
 with a padlock rather than a lock for a tow hitch. The court noted that Wyers’
 specification had characterized the claimed invention as being in the field of
 locking devices, thus at least suggesting that the sealed padlock reference was in
 the same field of endeavor. However, the court also observed that even if sealed
 padlocks were not in the same field of endeavor, they were nevertheless reasonably
 pertinent to the problem of avoiding contamination of a locking mechanism for tow
 hitches. The court explained that the Supreme Court’s decision in *KSR* “directs [it] to construe the scope of analogous art
 broadly.” *Id.* at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530. For these reasons,
 the court found that Master Lock’s asserted references were analogous prior art,
 and therefore relevant to the obviousness inquiry. 

The court then turned to the question of whether
 there would have been adequate motivation to combine the prior art elements as had
 been urged by Master Lock. The court recalled the *Graham* inquiries, and also emphasized the “expansive and flexible” post-KSR approach to
 obviousness that must not “deny factfinders recourse to common sense.” *Id.* at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530-31. (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415, 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1395, 1397). The
 court stated: 
> *KSR* and our later cases establish that the legal
> determination of obviousness may include recourse to logic, judgment, and
> common sense, in lieu of expert testimony. . . . Thus, in appropriate cases,
> the ultimate inference as to the existence of a motivation to combine
> references may boil down to a question of “common sense,” appropriate for
> resolution on summary judgment or JMOL.

*Id.* at 1240, 82 USPQ2d at 1531 (citing *Perfect Web
 Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA, Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1330, 92 USPQ2d, 1849,
 1854 (Fed. Cir. 2009); *Ball Aerosol,* 555 F.3d at 993, 89 USPQ2d
 1870, 1875 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). 

After reviewing these principles, the court
 proceeded to explain why adequate motivation to combine had been established in
 this case. With regard to the sleeve improvement, it pointed out that the need for
 different sizes of hitch pins was well known in the art, and that this was a known
 source of inconvenience and expense for users. The court also mentioned the
 marketplace aspect of the issue, noting that space on store shelves was at a
 premium, and that removable sleeves addressed this economic concern. As to the
 sealing improvement, the court pointed out that both internal and external seals
 were well-known means to protect locks from contaminants. The court concluded that
 the constituent elements were being employed in accordance with their recognized
 functions, and would have predictably retained their respective functions when
 combined as suggested by Master Lock. The court cited *In re
 O’Farrell,* 853 F.2d 894, 904 (Fed. Cir. 1988) for the proposition
 that a reasonable expectation of success is a requirement for a proper
 determination of obviousness. 

Office personnel should note that although the
 Federal Circuit invoked the idea of common sense in support of a conclusion of
 obviousness, it did not end its explanation there. Rather, the court explained why
 a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, in view of the
 facts relevant to the case, would have found the claimed inventions to have been
 obvious. The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the
 claimed invention would have been obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. The Court quoting *In
 re Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006),
 stated that “[R]ejections on obviousness cannot be sustained by mere conclusory
 statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational
 underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.” See **[MPEP §
 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)**, subsection III. Office personnel should continue
 to provide a reasoned explanation for every obviousness rejection. 

**Example 8:**

The claim in *DePuy Spine, Inc. v.
 Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,* 567 F.3d 1314, 90 USPQ2d 1865 (Fed.
 Cir. 2009), was directed to a polyaxial pedicle screw used in spinal surgeries
 that included a compression member for pressing a screw head against a receiver
 member. A prior art reference (Puno) disclosed all of the elements of the claim
 except for the compression member. Instead, the screw head in Puno was separated
 from the receiver member to achieve a shock absorber effect, allowing some motion
 between receiver member and the vertebrae. The missing compression member was
 readily found in another prior art reference (Anderson), which disclosed an
 external fracture immobilization splint for immobilizing long bones with a swivel
 clamp capable of polyaxial movement until rigidly secured by a compression member.
 It was asserted during trial that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized
 that the addition of Anderson’s compression member to Puno’s device would have
 achieved a rigidly locked polyaxial pedicle screw covered by the claim. 

In conducting its analysis, the Federal Circuit
 noted that the “predictable result” discussed in *KSR* refers not
 only to the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being physically
 combined, but also that the combination would have worked for its intended
 purpose. In this case, it was successfully argued that Puno “teaches away” from a
 rigid screw because Puno warned that rigidity increases the likelihood that the
 screw will fail within the human body, rendering the device inoperative for its
 intended purpose. In fact, the reference did not merely express a general
 preference for pedicle screws having a “shock absorber” effect, but rather
 expressed concern for failure and stated that the shock absorber feature
 “decrease[s] the chance of failure of the screw of the bone-screw interface”
 because “it prevent[s] direct transfer of load from the rod to the bone-screw
 interface.” Thus, the alleged reason to combine the prior art elements of Puno and
 Anderson—increasing the rigidity of the screw—ran contrary to the prior art that
 taught that increasing rigidity would result in a greater likelihood of failure.
 In view of this teaching and the backdrop of collective teachings of the prior
 art, the Federal Circuit determined that Puno teaches away from the proposed
 combination such that a person of ordinary skill would have been deterred from
 combining the references as proposed. Secondary considerations evaluated by the
 Federal Circuit relating to failure by others and copying also supported the view
 that the combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention. 

***B.******Simple Substitution of One Known Element for Another To Obtain
 Predictable Results***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a device (method,
 product, etc.) which differed from the claimed device by the substitution of
 some components (step, element, etc.) with other components;
- (2) a finding that the substituted components and their functions
 were known in the art;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
 substituted one known element for another, and the results of the substitution
 would have been predictable; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of
 obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that the substitution of one known element for another yields
 predictable results to one of ordinary skill in the art. If any of these findings
 cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the
 claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

**Example 1:**

The claimed invention in *In re Fout,* 675 F.2d
 297, 213 USPQ 532 (CCPA 1982) was directed to a method for decaffeinating coffee
 or tea. The prior art (Pagliaro) method produced a decaffeinated vegetable
 material and trapped the caffeine in a fatty material (such as oil). The caffeine
 was then removed from the fatty material by an aqueous extraction process.
 Applicant (Fout) substituted an evaporative distillation step for the aqueous
 extraction step. The prior art (Waterman) suspended coffee in oil and then
 directly distilled the caffeine through the oil. The court found that “[b]ecause
 both Pagliaro and Waterman teach a method for separating caffeine from oil, it
 would have been *prima facie* obvious to substitute one method
 for the other. Express suggestion to substitute one equivalent for another need
 not be present to render such substitution obvious.” *Id.* at
 301, 213 USPQ at 536. 

**Example 2:**

The claimed invention in *In re O’Farrell,* 853
 F.2d 894, 7 USPQ2d 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1988) was directed to a method for synthesizing
 a protein in a transformed bacterial host species by substituting a heterologous
 gene for a gene native to the host species. Generally speaking, protein synthesis *in vivo* follows a path from DNA to mRNA. Although the prior
 art Polisky article (authored by two of the three joint inventors of the
 application) had explicitly suggested employing the method described for protein
 synthesis, the inserted heterologous gene exemplified in the article was one that
 normally did not proceed all the way to the protein production step, but instead
 terminated with the mRNA. A second reference to Bahl had described a general
 method of inserting chemically synthesized DNA into a plasmid. Thus, it would have
 been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to replace the prior art gene
 with another gene known to lead to protein production, because one of ordinary
 skill in the art would have been able to carry out such a substitution, and the
 results were reasonably predictable. 

In response to applicant’s argument that there had been
 significant unpredictability in the field of molecular biology at the time of the
 invention, the court stated that the level of skill was quite high and that the
 teachings of Polisky, even taken alone, contained detailed enabling methodology
 and included the suggestion that the modification would be successful for
 synthesis of proteins. 

This is not a situation where the rejection is a statement that
 it would have been “obvious to try” without more. Here there was a reasonable
 expectation of success. “Obviousness does not require absolute predictability of
 success.” *Id.* at 903, 7 USPQ2d at 1681. 

**Example 3:**

The fact pattern in *Ruiz v. AB Chance Co.,* 357
 F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) is set forth above in Example 2 in
 subsection I.A., above. 

The prior art showed differing load-bearing members and differing
 means of attaching the foundation to the member. Therefore, it would have been
 obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to substitute the metal bracket taught
 in Gregory for Fuller’s concrete haunch for the predictable result of transferring
 the load. 

**Example 4:**

The claimed invention in *Ex parte Smith,* 83
 USPQ2d 1509 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2007), was a pocket insert for a bound book
 made by gluing a base sheet and a pocket sheet of paper together to form a
 continuous two-ply seam defining a closed pocket. The prior art (Wyant) disclosed
 at least one pocket formed by folding a single sheet and securing the folder
 portions along the inside margins using any convenient bonding method. The prior
 art (Wyant) did not disclose bonding the sheets to form a continuous two-ply seam.
 The prior art (Dick) disclosed a pocket that is made by stitching or otherwise
 securing two sheets along three of its four edges to define a closed pocket with
 an opening along its fourth edge. 

In considering the teachings of Wyant and Dick, the Board “found
 that (1) each of the claimed elements is found within the scope and content of the
 prior art; (2) one of ordinary skill in the art could have combined the elements
 as claimed by methods known at the time the invention was made; and (3) one of
 ordinary skill in the art would have recognized at the time the invention was made
 that the capabilities or functions of the combination were predictable.” Citing *KSR,* the Board concluded that “[t]he substitution of the
 continuous, two-ply seam of Dick for the folded seam of Wyant thus is no more than
 the simple substitution of one known element for another or the mere application
 of a known technique to a piece of prior art ready for improvement. 

**Example 5:**

The claimed invention in *In re ICON Health
 & Fitness, Inc.,* 496 F.3d 1374, 83 USPQ2d 1746 (Fed. Cir. 2007),
 was directed to a treadmill with a folding tread base that swivels into an upright
 storage position, including a gas spring connected between the tread base and the
 upright structure to assist in stably retaining the tread base in the storage
 position. On reexamination, the examiner rejected the claims as obvious based on a
 combination of references including an advertisement (Damark) for a folding
 treadmill demonstrating all of the claim elements other than the gas spring, and a
 patent (Teague) with a gas spring. Teague was directed to a bed that folds into a
 cabinet using a novel dual-action spring that reverses force as the mechanism
 passes a neutral position, rather than a single-action spring that would provide a
 force pushing the bed closed at all times. The dual-action spring reduced the
 force required to open the bed from the closed position, while reducing the force
 required to lift the bed from the open position. 

The Federal Circuit addressed the propriety of
 making the combination since Teague was in a different field than the application.
 Teague was found to be reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed in the
 application because the folding mechanism did not require any particular focus on
 treadmills, but rather generally addressed problems of supporting the weight of
 such a mechanism and providing a stable resting position. 

The court also considered whether one skilled in the
 art would have been led to combine the teachings of Damark and Teague. Appellant
 argued that Teague teaches away from the invention because it directs one skilled
 in the art not to use single-action springs and does not satisfy the claim
 limitations as the dual-action springs would render the invention inoperable. The
 Federal Circuit considered these arguments and found that, while Teague at most
 teaches away from using single-action springs to decrease the opening force, it
 actually instructed that single-action springs provide the result desired by the
 inventors, which was to increase the opening force provided by gravity. As to
 inoperability, the claims were not limited to single-action springs and were so
 broad as to encompass anything that assists in stably retaining the tread base,
 which is the function that Teague accomplished. Additionally, the fact that the
 counterweight mechanism from Teague used a large spring, which appellant argued
 would overpower the treadmill mechanism, ignores the modifications that one
 skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from the prior art. One skilled
 in the art would size the components from Teague appropriately for the
 application. 

 *ICON* is another useful example for understanding the scope of
 analogous art. The art applied concerned retaining mechanisms for folding beds,
 not treadmills. When determining whether a reference may properly be applied to an
 invention in a different field of endeavor, it is necessary to consider the
 problem to be solved. It is certainly possible that a reference may be drawn in
 such a way that its usefulness as a teaching is narrowly restricted. However,
 in *ICON,* the problem to be solved was not limited to the
 teaching of the “treadmill” concept. The Teague reference was analogous art
 because “Teague and the current application both address the need to stably retain
 a folding mechanism,” and because “nothing about ICON’s folding mechanism requires
 any particular focus on treadmills,” *Id.* at 1378, 1380, 83
 USPQ2d at 1749-50. 

*ICON* is also informative as to the relationship between the
 problem to be solved and existence of a reason to combine. “Indeed, while perhaps
 not dispositive of the issue, the finding that Teague, by addressing a similar
 problem, provides analogous art to ICON’s application goes a long way towards
 demonstrating a reason to combine the two references. Because ICON’s broad claims
 read on embodiments addressing that problem as described by Teague, the prior art
 here indicates a reason to incorporate its teachings.” *Id.* at
 1380-81, 83 USPQ2d at 1751. 

The Federal Circuit’s discussion in *ICON* also makes clear that if the reference does not teach
 that a combination is undesirable, then it cannot be said to teach away. An
 assessment of whether a combination would render the device inoperable must not
 “ignore the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device
 borrowed from the prior art.” *Id.* at 1382, 83 USPQ2d at
 1752. 

**Example 6:**

*Agrizap, Inc. v. Woodstream Corp.,* 520 F.3d 1337, 86 USPQ2d
 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2008), involved a stationary pest control device for electrocution
 of pests such as rats and gophers, in which the device is set in an area where the
 pest is likely to encounter it. The only difference between the claimed device and
 the prior art stationary pest control device was that the claimed device employed
 a resistive electrical switch, while the prior art device used a mechanical
 pressure switch. A resistive electrical switch was taught in two prior art
 patents, in the contexts of a hand-held pest control device and a cattle prod. 

In determining that the claimed invention was
 obvious, the Federal Circuit noted that “[t]he asserted claims simply substitute a
 resistive electrical switch for the mechanical pressure switch” employed in the
 prior art device. *Id.* at 1344, 86 USPQ2d at 1115. In this case,
 the prior art concerning the hand-held devices revealed that the function of the
 substituted resistive electrical switch was well known and predictable, and that
 it could be used in a pest control device. According to the Federal Circuit, the
 references that taught the hand-held devices showed that “the use of an animal
 body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an electric
 charge was already well known in the prior art.” *Id.* Finally,
 the Federal Circuit noted that the problem solved by using the resistive
 electrical switch in the prior art hand-held devices – malfunction of mechanical
 switches due to dirt and dampness – also pertained to the prior art stationary
 pest control device. 

The Federal Circuit recognized *Agrizap* as “a textbook case of when the asserted claims involve a
 combination of familiar elements according to known methods that does no more than
 yield predictable results.” *Id.**Agrizap* exemplifies a strong case of obviousness based on
 simple substitution that was not overcome by the objective evidence of
 nonobviousness offered. It also demonstrates that analogous art is not limited to
 the field of the inventor’s endeavor, in that one of the references that used an
 animal body as a resistive switch to complete a circuit for the generation of an
 electric charge was not in the field of pest control. 

**Example 7:**

The invention at issue in *Muniauction,
 Inc. v. Thomson Corp.,* 532 F.3d 1318, 87 USPQ2d1350 (Fed. Cir. 2008),
 was a method for auctioning municipal bonds over the Internet. A municipality
 could offer a package of bond instruments of varying principal amounts and
 maturity dates, and an interested buyer would then submit a bid comprising a price
 and interest rate for each maturity date. It was also possible for the interested
 buyer to bid on a portion of the offering. The claimed invention considered all of
 the noted parameters to determine the best bid. It operated on conventional Web
 browsers and allowed participants to monitor the course of the auction. 

The only difference between the prior art bidding
 system and the claimed invention was the use of a conventional Web browser. At
 trial, the district court had determined that Muniauction’s claims were not
 obvious. Thomson argued that the claimed invention amounted to incorporating a Web
 browser into a prior art auction system, and was therefore obvious in light of *KSR.* Muniauction rebutted the argument by offering evidence
 of skepticism by experts, copying, praise, and commercial success. Although the
 district court found the evidence to be persuasive of nonobviousness, the Federal
 Circuit disagreed. It noted that a nexus between the claimed invention and the
 proffered evidence was lacking because the evidence was not coextensive with the
 claims at issue. For this reason, the Federal Circuit determined that
 Muniauction’s evidence of secondary considerations was not entitled to substantial
 weight. 

The Federal Circuit analogized this case to *Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price, Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157,
 82 USPQ2d 1687 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The *Leapfrog* case involved a
 determination of obviousness based on application of modern electronics to a prior
 art mechanical children’s learning device. In *Leapfrog,* the
 court noted that market pressures would have prompted a person of ordinary skill
 to use modern electronics in the prior art device. Similarly in *Muniauction,* market pressures would have prompted a person
 of ordinary skill to use a conventional Web browser in a method of auctioning
 municipal bonds. 

**Example 8:**

In *Aventis Pharma Deutschland v. Lupin
 Ltd.,* 499 F.3d 1293, 84 USPQ2d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the claims were
 drawn to the 5(S) stereoisomer of the blood pressure drug ramipril in
 stereochemically pure form, and to compositions and methods requiring 5(S)
 ramipril. The 5(S) stereoisomer is one in which all five stereocenters in the
 ramipril molecule are in the S rather than the R configuration. A mixture of
 various stereoisomers including 5(S) ramipril had been taught by the prior art.
 The question before the court was whether the purified single stereoisomer would
 have been obvious over the known mixture of stereoisomers. 

The record showed that the presence of multiple S
 stereocenters in drugs similar to ramipril was known to be associated with
 enhanced therapeutic efficacy. For example, when all of the stereocenters were in
 the S form in the related drug enalapril (SSS enalapril) as compared with only two
 stereocenters in the S form (SSR enalapril), the therapeutic potency was 700 times
 as great. There was also evidence to indicate that conventional methods could be
 used to separate the various stereoisomers of ramipril. 

The district court saw the issue as a close case,
 because, in its view, there was no clear motivation in the prior art to isolate
 5(S) ramipril. However, the Federal Circuit disagreed, and found that the claims
 would have been obvious. The Federal Circuit cautioned that requiring such a
 clearly stated motivation in the prior art to isolate 5(S) ramipril ran counter to
 the Supreme Court’s decision in KSR, and the court stated: 
> Requiring an explicit teaching to purify the
> 5(S) stereoisomer from a mixture in which it is the active ingredient is
> precisely the sort of rigid application of the TSM test that was criticized in *KSR.*

*Id.* at 1301, 84 USPQ2d at 1204. The *Aventis* court also relied on the settled principle that in chemical cases, structural
 similarity can provide the necessary reason to modify prior art teachings. The
 Federal Circuit also addressed the kind of teaching that would be sufficient in
 the absence of an explicitly stated prior art-based motivation, explaining that an
 expectation of similar properties in light of the prior art can be sufficient,
 even without an explicit teaching that the compound will have a particular
 utility. 

In the chemical arts, the cases involving so-called
 “lead compounds” form an important subgroup of the obviousness cases that are
 based on substitution. The Federal Circuit has had a number of opportunities since
 the *KSR* decision to discuss the circumstances under which it
 would have been obvious to modify a known compound to arrive at a claimed
 compound. The following cases explore the selection of a lead compound, the need
 to provide a reason for any proposed modification, and the predictability of the
 result. 

**Example 9:**

*Eisai Co. Ltd. v. Dr. Reddy’s Labs., Ltd.,* 533 F.3d 1353, 87
 USPQ2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 2008), concerns the pharmaceutical compound rabeprazole.
 Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor for treating stomach ulcers and related
 disorders. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s summary judgment of
 nonobviousness, stating that no reason had been advanced to modify the prior art
 compound in a way that would destroy an advantageous property. 

Co-defendant Teva based its obviousness argument on
 the structural similarity between rabeprazole and lansoprazole. The compounds were
 recognized as sharing a common core, and the Federal Circuit characterized
 lansoprazole as a “lead compound.” The prior art compound lansoprazole was useful
 for the same indications as rabeprazole, and differed from rabeprazole only in
 that lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy substituent at the 4-position of the
 pyridine ring, while rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy substituent. The trifluoro
 substituent of lansoprazole was known to be a beneficial feature because it
 conferred lipophilicity to the compound. The ability of a person of ordinary skill
 to carry out the modification to introduce the methoxypropoxy substituent, and the
 predictability of the result were not addressed. 

Despite the significant similarity between the
 structures, the Federal Circuit did not find any reason to modify the lead
 compound. According to the Federal Circuit: 
> Obviousness based on structural similarity thus
> can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of
> ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound (i.e. a
> lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound. . . . In
> keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry, the requisite
> motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be
> explicit in the art. Rather “it is sufficient to show that the claimed and
> prior art compounds possess a ‘sufficiently close relationship . . . to create
> an expectation,’ in light of the totality of the prior art, that the new
> compound will have ‘similar properties’ to the old.” *Id.* at
> 1357, 87 USPQ2d at 1455. (citations omitted)

The prior art taught that introducing a fluorinated
 substituent was known to increase lipophilicity, so a skilled artisan would have
 expected that replacing the trifluoroethoxy substituent with a methoxypropoxy
 substituent would have reduced the lipophilicity of the compound. Thus, the prior
 art created the expectation that rabeprazole would be less useful than
 lansoprazole as a drug for treating stomach ulcers and related disorders because
 the proposed modification would have destroyed an advantageous property of the
 prior art compound. The compound was not obvious as argued by Teva because, upon
 consideration of all of the facts of the case, a person of ordinary skill in the
 art at the time of the invention would not have had a reason to modify
 lansoprazole so as to form rabeprazole. 

Office personnel are cautioned that the term “lead
 compound” in a particular opinion can have a contextual meaning that may vary from
 the way a pharmaceutical chemist might use the term. In the field of
 pharmaceutical chemistry, the term “lead compound” has been defined variously as
 “a chemical compound that has pharmacological or biological activity and whose
 chemical structure is used as a starting point for chemical modifications in order
 to improve potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic parameters;” “[a] compound
 that exhibits pharmacological properties which suggest its development;” and “a
 potential drug being tested for safety and efficacy.” See, e.g.,
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound, accessed January 13, 2010;
 www.combichemistry.com/glossary_k.html, accessed January 13, 2010; and
 www.buildingbiotechnology.com/glossary4.php, accessed January 13, 2010. 

The Federal Circuit in *Eisai* makes it clear that from the perspective of the law of obviousness, any known
 compound might possibly serve as a lead compound: “Obviousness based on structural
 similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have
 led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound
 (i.e. a lead compound) in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound.” *Eisai,* 533 F.3d at 1357, 87 USPQ2d at 1455. Thus, Office
 personnel should recognize that a proper obviousness rejection of a claimed
 compound that is useful as a drug might be made beginning with an inactive
 compound, if, for example, the reasons for modifying a prior art compound to
 arrive at the claimed compound have nothing to do with pharmaceutical activity.
 The inactive compound would not be considered to be a lead compound by
 pharmaceutical chemists, but could potentially be used as such when considering
 obviousness. Office personnel might also base an obviousness rejection on a known
 compound that pharmaceutical chemists would not select as a lead compound due to
 expense, handling issues, or other business considerations. However, there must be
 some reason for starting with that particular lead compound other than the mere
 fact that the “lead compound” exists. See *Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm.
 USA, Inc.,* 566 F.3d 999, 1007, 91 USPQ2d 1018, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
 (holding that there must be some reason “to select and modify a known compound”); *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Mylan Labs, Inc.,* 520 F.3d
 1358, 1364, 86 USPQ2d 1196, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2008). 

**Example 10:**

The claimed chemical compound was also found to be
 nonobvious in *Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA,
 Inc.,* 566 F.3d 989, 90 USPQ2d 1947 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The compound at
 issue was risedronate – the active ingredient of Procter & Gamble’s
 osteoporosis drug Actonel®. Risedronate is an example
 of a bisphosphonate, which is a class of compounds known to inhibit bone
 resorption. 

When Procter & Gamble sued Teva for
 infringement, Teva defended by arguing invalidity for obviousness over one of
 Procter & Gamble’s earlier patents. The prior art patent did not teach
 risedronate, but instead taught thirty-six other similar compounds including 2-pyr
 EHDP that were potentially useful with regard to osteoporosis. Teva argued
 obviousness on the basis of structural similarity to 2-pyr EHDP, which is a
 positional isomer of risedronate. 

The district court found no reason to select 2-pyr
 EHDP as a lead compound in light of the unpredictable nature of the art, and no
 reason to modify it so as to obtain risedronate. In addition, there were
 unexpected results as to potency and toxicity. Therefore the district court found
 that Teva had not made a *prima facie* case, and even if it had,
 it was rebutted by evidence of unexpected results. 

The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s
 decision. The Federal Circuit did not deem it necessary in this case to consider
 the question of whether 2-pyr EHDP had been appropriately selected as a lead
 compound. Rather, the Federal Circuit reasoned that, if 2-pyr EHDP is presumed to
 be an appropriate lead compound, there must be both a reason to modify it so as to
 make risedronate and a reasonable expectation of success. Here, there was no
 evidence that the necessary modifications would have been routine, so there would
 have been no reasonable expectation of success. 

*Procter & Gamble* is also informative in its discussion of
 the treatment of secondary considerations of non-obviousness. Although the court
 found that no *prima facie* case of obviousness had been
 presented, it proceeded to analyze Procter & Gamble’s proffered evidence
 countering the alleged *prima facie* case in some detail, thus
 shedding light on the proper treatment of such evidence. 

The Federal Circuit noted in dicta that even if a *prima facie* case of obviousness had been established,
 sufficient evidence of unexpected results was introduced to rebut such a showing.
 At trial, the witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate
 were not expected, offering evidence that researchers did not predict either the
 potency or the low dose at which the compound was effective. Tests comparing
 risedronate to a compound in the prior art reference showed that risedronate
 outperformed the other compound by a substantial margin, could be administered in
 a greater amount without an observable toxic effect, and was not lethal at the
 same levels as the other compound. The weight of the evidence and the credibility
 of the witnesses were sufficient to show unexpected results that would have
 rebutted an obviousness determination. Thus, nonobviousness can be shown when a
 claimed invention is shown to have unexpectedly superior properties when compared
 to the prior art. 

The court then addressed the evidence of commercial
 success of risedronate and the evidence that risedronate met a long felt need. The
 court pointed out that little weight was to be afforded to the commercial success
 because the competing product was also assigned to Procter & Gamble. However,
 the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s conclusion that risedronate met
 a long-felt, but unsatisfied need. The court rejected Teva’s contention that
 because the competing drug was available before
 Actonel®, there was no unmet need that the invention
 satisfied. The court emphasized that whether there was a long-felt but unsatisfied
 need is to be evaluated based on the circumstances as of the filing date of the
 challenged invention – not as of the date that the invention is brought to market. 

It should be noted that the lead compound cases do
 not stand for the proposition that identification of a single lead compound is
 necessary in every obviousness rejection of a chemical compound. For example, one
 might envision a suggestion in the prior art to formulate a compound having
 certain structurally defined moieties, or moieties with certain properties. If a
 person of ordinary skill would have known how to synthesize such a compound, and
 the structural and/or functional result could reasonably have been predicted, then
 a *prima facie* case of obviousness of the claimed chemical
 compound might exist even without identification of a particular lead compound. As
 a second example, it could be possible to view a claimed compound as consisting of
 two known compounds attached via a chemical linker. The claimed compound might
 properly be found to have been obvious if there would have been a reason to link
 the two, if one of ordinary skill would have known how to do so, and if the
 resulting compound would have been the predictable result of the linkage
 procedure. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that in certain situations, it
 may be proper to reject a claimed chemical compound as obvious even without
 identifying a single lead compound. 

**Example 11:**

The decision reached by the Federal Circuit
 in *Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc.,* 566 F.3d 999,
 91 USPQ2d 1018 (Fed. Cir. 2009), as discussed below, involved a motion for
 preliminary injunction and did not include a final determination of obviousness.
 However, the case is instructive as to the issue of selecting a lead compound. 

The technology involved in *Altana* was the compound pantoprazole, which is the active
 ingredient in Altana’s antiulcer drug Protonix®.
 Pantoprazole belongs to a class of compounds known as proton pump inhibitors that
 are used to treat gastric acid disorders in the stomach. 

Altana accused Teva of infringement. The district
 court denied Altana’s motion for preliminary injunction for failure to establish a
 likelihood of success on the merits, determining that Teva had demonstrated a
 substantial question of invalidity for obviousness in light of one of Altana’s
 prior patents. Altana’s patent discussed a compound referred to as compound 12,
 which was one of eighteen compounds disclosed. The claimed compound pantoprazole
 was structurally similar to compound 12. The district court found that one of
 ordinary skill in the art would have selected compound 12 as a lead compound for
 modification, and the Federal Circuit affirmed. 

Obviousness of a chemical compound in view of its
 structural similarity to a prior art compound may be shown by identifying some
 line of reasoning that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select
 and modify the prior art compound in a particular way to produce the claimed
 compound. The necessary line of reasoning can be drawn from any number of sources
 and need not necessarily be explicitly found in the prior art of record. The
 Federal Circuit determined that ample evidence supported the district court’s
 finding that compound 12 was a natural choice for further development. For
 example, Altana’s prior art patent claimed that its compounds, including compound
 12, were improvements over the prior art; compound 12 was disclosed as one of the
 more potent of the eighteen compounds disclosed; the patent examiner had
 considered the compounds of Altana’s prior art patent to be relevant during the
 prosecution of the patent in suit; and experts had opined that one of ordinary
 skill in the art would have selected the eighteen compounds to pursue further
 investigation into their potential as proton pump inhibitors. 

In response to Altana’s argument that the prior art
 must point to only a single lead compound for further development, the Federal
 Circuit stated that a “restrictive view of the lead compound test would present a
 rigid test similar to the teaching-suggestion-motivation test that the Supreme
 Court explicitly rejected in *KSR* . . . . The district court in
 this case employed a flexible approach – one that was admittedly preliminary – and
 found that the defendants had raised a substantial question that one of skill in
 the art would have used the more potent compounds of [Altana’s prior art] patent,
 including compound 12, as a starting point from which to pursue further
 development efforts. That finding was not clearly erroneous.” *Id.* at 1008, 91 USPQ2d at 1025. 

***C.******Use of Known Technique To Improve Similar Devices (Methods, or Products)
 in the Same Way***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a “base” device
 (method, or product) upon which the claimed invention can be seen as an
 “improvement;”
- (2) a finding that the prior art contained a “comparable” device
 (method, or product that is not the same as the base device) that has been
 improved in the same way as the claimed invention;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
 applied the known “improvement” technique in the same way to the “base” device
 (method, or product) and the results would have been predictable to one of
 ordinary skill in the art; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that a method of enhancing a particular class of devices (methods, or
 products) has been made part of the ordinary capabilities of one skilled in the art
 based upon the teaching of such improvement in other situations. One of ordinary
 skill in the art would have been capable of applying this known method of enhancement
 to a “base” device (method, or product) in the prior art and the results would have
 been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. “It's enough … to show that
 there was a known problem … in the art, that [another reference] … helped address
 that issue, and that combining the teachings of [the two references] wasn't beyond
 the skill of an ordinary artisan. Nothing more is required to show a motivation to
 combine under *KSR.*” See *Intel Corp. v. PACT XPP Schweiz
 AG,* 61 F.4th 1373, 1380-81, 2023 USPQ2d 297 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (finding
 that both prior art references “address the same problem and that [the secondary
 reference’s] cache was a known way to address that problem is precisely the reason
 that there's a motivation to combine under *KSR* and our
 precedent.”). 

The Supreme Court in *KSR* noted
 that if the actual application of the technique would have been beyond the skill of
 one of ordinary skill in the art, then using the technique would not have been
 obvious. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 417, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. If any of these
 findings cannot be made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion
 that the claim would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

**Example 1:**

The claimed invention in *In re Nilssen,* 851
 F.2d 1401, 7 USPQ2d 1500 (Fed. Cir. 1988) was directed to a “means by which the
 self-oscillating inverter in a power-line-operated inverter-type fluorescent lamp
 ballast is disabled in case the output current from the inverter exceeds some
 pre-established threshold level for more than a very brief period.” *Id.* at 1402, 7 USPQ2d at 1501 That is, the current output
 was monitored, and if the current output exceeded some threshold for a specified
 short time, an actuation signal was sent and the inverter was disabled to protect
 it from damage. 

The prior art (a USSR certificate) described a device for
 protecting an inverter circuit in an undisclosed manner via a control means. The
 device indicated the high-load condition by way of the control means, but did not
 indicate the specific manner of overload protection. The prior art (Kammiller)
 disclosed disabling the inverter in the event of a high-load current condition in
 order to protect the inverter circuit. That is, the overload protection was
 achieved by disabling the inverter by means of a cutoff switch. 

The court found “it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
 skill in the art to use the threshold signal produced in the USSR device to
 actuate a cutoff switch to render the inverter inoperative as taught by
 Kammiller.” *Id.* at 1403, 7 USPQ2d at 1502. That is, using the
 known technique of a cutoff switch for protecting a circuit to provide the
 protection desired in the inverter circuit of the USSR document would have been
 obvious to one of ordinary skill. 

**Example 2:**

The fact pattern in *Ruiz v. AB Chance Co.,* 357
 F.3d 1270, 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004) is set forth above in Example 2 in
 subsection I.A. 

The nature of the problem to be solved may lead inventors to look
 at references relating to possible solutions to that problem. *Id.* at 1277, 69 USPQ2d at 1691. Therefore, it would have
 been obvious to use a metal bracket (as shown in Gregory) with the screw anchor
 (as shown in Fuller) to underpin unstable foundations. 

***D.******Applying a Known Technique to a Known Device (Method, or Product) Ready
 for Improvement To Yield Predictable Results***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that the prior art contained a “base” device
 (method, or product) upon which the claimed invention can be seen as an
 “improvement;”
- (2) a finding that the prior art contained a known technique that
 is applicable to the base device (method, or product);
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art would have
 recognized that applying the known technique would have yielded predictable
 results and resulted in an improved system; and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that a particular known technique was recognized as part of the
 ordinary capabilities of one skilled in the art. One of ordinary skill in the art
 would have been capable of applying this known technique to a known device (method,
 or product) that was ready for improvement and the results would have been
 predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. If any of these findings cannot be
 made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would
 have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

**Example 1:**

The claimed invention in *Dann v. Johnston,* 425
 U.S. 219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) was directed towards a system (i.e., computer) for
 automatic record keeping of bank checks and deposits. In this system, a customer
 would put a numerical category code on each check or deposit slip. The check
 processing system would record these on the check in magnetic ink, just as it does
 for amount and account information. With this system in place, the bank can
 provide statements to customers that are broken down to give subtotals for each
 category. The claimed system also allowed the bank to print reports according to a
 style requested by the customer. As characterized by the Court, “[u]nder
 respondent’s invention, then, a general purpose computer is programmed to provide
 bank customers with an individualized and categorized breakdown of their
 transactions during the period in question.” *Id.* at 222, 189
 USPQ at 259. 

BASE SYSTEM - The nature of the use of data processing equipment
 and computer software in the banking industry was that banks routinely did much of
 the record-keeping automatically. In routine check processing, the system read any
 magnetic ink characters identifying the account and routing. The system also read
 the amount of the check and then printed that value in a designated area of the
 check. The check was then sent through a further data processing step which used
 the magnetic ink information to generate the appropriate records for transactions
 and for posting to the appropriate accounts. These systems included generating
 periodic statements for each account, such as the monthly statement sent to
 checking account customers. 

IMPROVED SYSTEM - The claimed invention supplemented this system
 by recording a category code which could be used to track expenditures by
 category. Again, the category code will be a number recorded on the check (or
 deposit slip) which will be read, converted into a magnetic ink imprint, and then
 processed in the data system to include the category code. This enabled reporting
 of data by category as opposed to only allowing reporting by account number. 

KNOWN TECHNIQUE - This is an application of a technique from the
 prior art – the use of account numbers (generally used to track an individual's
 total transactions) to solve the problem of how to track categories of
 expenditures to more finely account for a budget. That is, account numbers
 (identifying data capable of processing in the automatic data processing system)
 were used to distinguish between different customers. Furthermore, banks have long
 segregated debits attributable to service charges within any given separate
 account and have rendered their customers subtotals for those charges. Previously,
 one would have needed to set up separate accounts for each category and thus
 receive separate reports. Supplementing the account information with additional
 digits (the category codes) solved the problem by effectively creating a single
 account that can be treated as distinct accounts for tracking and reporting
 services. That is, the category code merely allowed what might previously have
 been separate accounts to be handled as a single account, but with a number of
 sub-accounts indicated in the report. 

The basic technique of putting indicia on data to enable standard
 sorting, searching, and reporting yielded no more than the predictable outcome
 which one of ordinary skill would have expected to achieve with this common tool
 of the trade and was therefore an obvious expedient. The Court held that “[t]he
 gap between the prior art and respondent’s system is simply not so great as to
 render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the art.” *Id.* at 230, 189 USPQ at 261. 

**Example 2:**

The fact pattern in *In re Nilssen,* 851 F.2d
 1401, 7 USPQ2d 1500 (Fed. Cir. 1988) is set forth above in Example 1 in subsection
 C. 

The court found “it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
 skill in the art to use the threshold signal produced in the USSR device to
 actuate a cutoff switch to render the inverter inoperative as taught by
 Kammiller.” *Id.* at 1403, 7 USPQ2d at 1502. The known
 technique of using a cutoff switch would have predictably resulted in protecting
 the inverter circuit. Therefore, it would have been within the skill of the
 ordinary artisan to use a cutoff switch in response to the actuation signal to
 protect the inverter. 

**Example 3:**

The claimed invention in *In re
 Urbanski,* 809 F.3d 1237, 1244, 117 USPQ2d 1499, 1504 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 was directed to a method of enzymatic hydrolysis of soy fiber to reduce water
 holding capacity, requiring reacting the soy fiber and enzyme in water for about
 60-120 minutes. The claims were rejected over two references, wherein the primary
 reference, Gross, taught using a reaction time of 5 to 72 hours and the secondary
 reference, Wong, taught using a reaction time of 100 to 240 minutes, preferably
 120 minutes. The applicant argued that modifying the primary reference in the
 manner suggested by the secondary reference would forego the benefits taught by
 the primary reference, thereby teaching away from the combination. The court found
 there was sufficient motivation to combine because both references recognized
 reaction time and degree of hydrolysis as result-effective variables, which can be
 varied to have a predictable effect on the final product; and the primary
 reference does not contain an express teaching away from the proposed
 modification. “Substantial evidence thus supports the Board’s finding that a
 person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to modify the Gross process by
 using a shorter reaction time, in order to obtain the favorable properties
 disclosed in Wong.” 

***E.******“Obvious To Try” – Choosing From a Finite Number of Identified,
 Predictable Solutions, With a Reasonable Expectation of Success***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that at the relevant time, there had been a
 recognized problem or need in the art, which may include a design need or
 market pressure to solve a problem;
- (2) a finding that there had been a finite number of identified,
 predictable potential solutions to the recognized need or problem;
- (3) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art could have
 pursued the known potential solutions with a reasonable expectation of success;
 and
- (4) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that “a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known
 options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success,
 it is likely that product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common
 sense. In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show
 that it was obvious under **[§ 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.”*KSR,* 550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. If any of these findings cannot be made, then
 this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would have been
 obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

The question of whether a claimed invention can be
 shown to be obvious based on an “obvious to try” line of reasoning has been explored
 extensively by the Federal Circuit in several cases since the *KSR* decision. The case law in this area is developing quickly in the chemical arts,
 although the rationale has been applied in other art areas as well. 

Some commentators on the *KSR* decision have expressed a concern that because inventive activities are always
 carried out in the context of what has come before and not in a vacuum, few
 inventions will survive scrutiny under an obvious to try standard. The cases decided
 since KSR have proved this fear to have been unfounded. Courts appear to be applying
 the KSR requirement for “a finite number of identified predictable solutions” in a
 manner that places particular emphasis on predictability and the reasonable
 expectations of those of ordinary skill in the art. 

The Federal Circuit pointed out the challenging nature
 of the task faced by the courts – and likewise by Office personnel – when considering
 the viability of an obvious to try argument: “The evaluation of the choices made by a
 skilled scientist, when such choices lead to the desired result, is a challenge to
 judicial understanding of how technical advance is achieved in the particular field
 of science or technology.” *Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc.,* 544 F.3d
 1341, 1352, 89 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Federal Circuit cautioned that
 an obviousness inquiry based on an obvious to try rationale must always be undertaken
 in the context of the subject matter in question, “including the characteristics of
 the science or technology, its state of advance, the nature of the known choices, the
 specificity or generality of the prior art, and the predictability of results in the
 area of interest.” *Id.*

**Example 1:**

The claimed invention in *Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex,
 Inc.,* 480 F.3d 1348, 82 USPQ2d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2007), was directed to
 the amlodipine besylate drug product, which was sold in tablet form in the United
 States under the trademark Norvasc®. Amlodipine and the
 use of besylate anions were both known at the time of the invention. Amlodipine
 was known to have the same therapeutic properties as were being claimed for the
 amlodipine besylate, but Pfizer discovered that the besylate form had better
 manufacturing properties (e.g., reduced “stickiness”). 

Pfizer argued that the results of forming amlodipine besylate
 would have been unpredictable and therefore nonobvious. The court rejected the
 notion that unpredictability could be equated with nonobviousness here, because
 there were only a finite number (53) of ***pharmaceutically acceptable*** salts to be tested for improved properties. 

The court found that one of ordinary skill in the art having
 problems with the machinability of amlodipine would have looked to forming a salt
 of the compound and would have been able to narrow the group of potential
 salt-formers to a group of 53 anions known to form pharmaceutically acceptable
 salts, which would be an acceptable number to form “a reasonable expectation of
 success.” 

**Example 2:**

The claimed invention in *Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs.,
 Inc.,* 464 F.3d 1286, 80 USPQ2d 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2006) was drawn to
 sustained-release formulations of the drug oxybutynin in which the drug is
 released at a specified rate over a 24-hour period. Oxybutynin was known to be
 highly water-soluble, and the specification had pointed out that development of
 sustained-release formulations of such drugs presented particular problems. 

A prior art patent to Morella had taught sustained-release
 compositions of highly water-soluble drugs, as exemplified by a sustained-release
 formulation of morphine. Morella had also identified oxybutynin as belonging to
 the class of highly water-soluble drugs. The Baichwal prior art patent had taught
 a sustained-release formulation of oxybutynin that had a different release rate
 than the claimed invention. Finally, the Wong prior art patent had taught a
 generally applicable method for delivery of drugs over a 24-hour period. Although
 Wong mentioned applicability of the disclosed method to several categories of
 drugs to which oxybutynin belonged, Wong did not specifically mention its
 applicability to oxybutynin. 

The court found that because the absorption properties of
 oxybutynin would have been reasonably predictable at the time of the invention,
 there would have been a reasonable expectation of successful development of a
 sustained-release formulation of oxybutynin as claimed. The prior art, as
 evidenced by the specification, had recognized the obstacles to be overcome in
 development of sustained-release formulations of highly water-soluble drugs, and
 had suggested a finite number of ways to overcome these obstacles. The claims were
 obvious because it would have been obvious to try the known methods for
 formulating sustained-release compositions, with a reasonable expectation of
 success. The court was not swayed by arguments of a lack of absolute
 predictability. 

**Example 3:**

The Federal Circuit’s decision in *In re
 Kubin,* 561 F.3d 1351, 90 USPQ2d 1417 (Fed. Cir. 2009), affirmed the
 Office’s determination in *Ex parte Kubin,* 83 USPQ2d 1410 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Int. 2007) that the claims in question, directed to an isolated
 nucleic acid molecule, would have been obvious over the prior art applied. The
 claim stated that the nucleic acid encoded a particular polypeptide. The encoded
 polypeptide was identified in the claim by its partially specified sequence, and
 by its ability to bind to a specified protein. 

A prior art patent to Valiante taught the polypeptide encoded by
 the claimed nucleic acid, but did not disclose either the sequence of the
 polypeptide, or the claimed isolated nucleic acid molecule. However, Valiante did
 disclose that by employing conventional methods such as those disclosed by a prior
 art laboratory manual by Sambrook, the sequence of the polypeptide could be
 determined, and the nucleic acid molecule could be isolated. In view of Valiante’s
 disclosure of the polypeptide, and of routine prior art methods for sequencing the
 polypeptide and isolating the nucleic acid molecule, the Board found that a person
 of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation that a
 nucleic acid molecule within the claimed scope could have been successfully
 obtained. 

Relying on *In re Deuel,* 51 F.3d 1552, 34
 USPQ2d 1210 (Fed. Cir. 1995), appellant argued that it was improper for the Office
 to use the polypeptide of the Valiante patent together with the methods described
 in Sambrook to reject a claim drawn to a specific nucleic acid molecule without
 providing a reference showing or suggesting a structurally similar nucleic acid
 molecule. Citing *KSR,* the Board stated that “when there is
 motivation to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified,
 predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the
 known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to anticipated
 success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and
 common sense.” *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 402-03, 82 USPQ2d at 1390. The
 Board noted that the problem facing those in the art was to isolate a specific
 nucleic acid, and there were a limited number of methods available to do so. The
 Board concluded that the skilled artisan would have had reason to try these
 methods with the reasonable expectation that at least one would be successful.
 Thus, isolating the specific nucleic acid molecule claimed was “the product not of
 innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.” *Id.*

The Board’s reasoning was substantially adopted by
 the Federal Circuit. However, it is important to note that in the *Kubin* decision, the Federal Circuit held that “the Supreme
 Court in *KSR* unambiguously discredited” the Federal Circuit’s
 decision in *Deuel,* insofar as it “implies the obviousness
 inquiry cannot consider that the combination of the claim’s constituent elements
 was ‘obvious to try.’” *Kubin,* 561 F.3d at 1358, 90 USPQ2d at
 1422. Instead, *Kubin* stated that *KSR* “resurrects” the Federal Circuit’s own wisdom in *O’Farrell,* in
 which “to differentiate between proper and improper applications of ‘obvious to
 try,’” the Federal Circuit “outlined two classes of situations where ‘obvious to
 try’ is erroneously equated with obviousness under **[§ 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *Kubin,* 561 F.3d at 1359, 90 USPQ2d at 1423. These two
 classes of situations are: (1) when what would have been “obvious to try” would
 have been to vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until
 one possibly arrived at a successful result, where the prior art gave either no
 indication of which parameters were critical or no direction as to which of many
 possible choices is likely to be successful; and (2) when what was “obvious to
 try” was to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a
 promising field of experimentation, where the prior art gave only general guidance
 as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it. *Id.* (citing *In re O’Farrell,* 853 F.2d
 894, 903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). 

**Example 4:**

*Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd.,* 492 F.3d
 1350, 83 USPQ2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2007), is an example of a chemical case in which
 the Federal Circuit found that the claimed invention was not obvious. The claimed
 compound was pioglitazone, a member of a class of drugs known as
 thiazolidinediones (TZDs) marketed by Takeda as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.
 The *Takeda* case brings together the concept of a “lead
 compound” and the obvious-to-try argument. 

Alphapharm had filed an Abbreviated New Drug
 Application with the Food and Drug Administration, which was a technical act of
 infringement of Takeda’s patent. When Takeda brought suit, Alphapharm’s defense
 was that Takeda’s patent was invalid due to obviousness. Alphapharm argued that a
 two-step modification – involving homologation and ring-walking – of a known
 compound identified as “compound b” would have produced pioglitazone, and that it
 was therefore obvious. 

The district court found that there would have been
 no reason to select compound b as a lead compound. There were a large number of
 similar prior art TZD compounds; fifty-four were specifically identified in
 Takeda’s prior patent, and the district court observed that “hundreds of millions”
 were more generally disclosed. Although the parties agreed that compound b
 represented the closest prior art, one reference taught certain disadvantageous
 properties associated with compound b, which according to the district court would
 have taught the skilled artisan not to select that compound as a lead compound.
 The district court found no *prima facie* case of obviousness,
 and stated that even if a *prima facie* case had been
 established, it would have been overcome in this case in view of the unexpected
 lack of toxicity of pioglitazone. 

The Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the
 district court, citing the need for a reason to modify a prior art compound. The
 Federal Circuit quoted *KSR,* stating: 
> The *KSR* Court recognized that
> “[w]hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there
> are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary
> skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical
> grasp.” *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397. In such
> circumstances, “the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that
> it was obvious under **[§ 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *Id.* That is not the case here. Rather than identify
> predictable solutions for antidiabetic treatment, the prior art disclosed a
> broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a
> lead compound for further investigation. Significantly, the closest prior art
> compound (compound b, the 6-methyl) exhibited negative properties that would
> have directed one of ordinary skill in the art away from that compound. Thus,
> this case fails to present the type of situation contemplated by the Court when
> it stated that an invention may be deemed obvious if it was “obvious to try.”
> The evidence showed that it was not obvious to try.

*Takeda,* 492 F.3d at 1359, 83 USPQ2d at 1176. 

Accordingly, Office personnel should recognize that
 the obvious to try rationale does not apply when the appropriate factual findings
 cannot be made. In *Takeda,* there was a recognized need for
 treatment of diabetes. However, there was no finite number of identified,
 predictable solutions to the recognized need, and no reasonable expectation of
 success. There were numerous known TZD compounds, and although one clearly
 represented the closest prior art, its known disadvantages rendered it unsuitable
 as a starting point for further research, and taught the skilled artisan away from
 its use. Furthermore, even if there had been reason to select compound b, there
 had been no reasonable expectation of success associated with the particular
 modifications necessary to transform compound b into the claimed compound
 pioglitazone. Thus, an obviousness rejection based on an obvious to try rationale
 was not appropriate in this situation. 

**Example 5:**

The case of *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v.
 Mylan Labs, Inc.,* 520 F.3d 1358, 86 USPQ2d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 2008),
 provides another example in which a chemical compound was determined not to be
 obvious. The claimed subject matter was topiramate, which is used as an
 anti-convulsant. 

In the course of working toward a new anti-diabetic
 drug, Ortho-McNeil’s scientist had unexpectedly discovered that a reaction
 intermediate had anti-convulsant properties. Mylan’s defense of invalidity due to
 obviousness rested on an obvious to try argument. However, Mylan did not explain
 why it would have been obvious to begin with an anti-diabetic drug precursor,
 especially the specific one that led to topiramate, if one had been seeking an
 anti-convulsant drug. The district court ruled on summary judgment that
 Ortho-McNeil’s patent was not invalid for obviousness. 

The Federal Circuit affirmed. The Federal Circuit
 pointed out that there was no apparent reason a person of ordinary skill would
 have chosen the particular starting compound or the particular synthetic pathway
 that led to topiramate as an intermediate. Furthermore, there would have been no
 reason to test that intermediate for anticonvulsant properties if treating
 diabetes had been the goal. The Federal Circuit recognized an element of
 serendipity in this case, which runs counter to the requirement for
 predictability. Summarizing their conclusion with regard to Mylan’s obvious to try
 argument, the Federal Circuit stated: 
> [T]his invention, contrary to Mylan’s
> characterization, does not present a finite (and small in the context of the
> art) number of options easily traversed to show obviousness. . . . *KSR* posits a situation with a finite, and in the context
> of the art, small or easily traversed, number of options that would convince an
> ordinarily skilled artisan of obviousness. . . . [T]his clearly is not the
> easily traversed, small and finite number of alternatives that *KSR* suggested might support an inference of obviousness. *Id.* at 1364, 86 USPQ2d at 1201.

Thus, *Ortho-McNeil* helps to
 clarify the Supreme Court’s requirement in KSR for “a finite number” of
 predictable solutions when an obvious to try rationale is applied: under the
 Federal Circuit’s case law “finite” means “small or easily traversed” in the
 context of the art in question. As taught in *Abbott,* discussed
 above, it is essential that the inquiry be placed in the context of the subject
 matter at issue, and each case must be decided on its own facts. 

**Example 6:**

In *Bayer Schering Pharma A.G. v. Barr
 Labs., Inc.,* 575 F.3d 1341, 91 USPQ2d 1569 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the
 claimed invention was an oral contraceptive containing micronized drospirenone
 marketed as Yasmin®. The prior art compound
 drospirenone was known to be a poorly water-soluble, acid-sensitive compound with
 contraceptive effects. It was also known in the art that micronization improves
 the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs. 

Based on the known acid sensitivity, Bayer had
 studied how effectively an enteric-coated drospirenone tablet delivered a
 formulation as compared to an intravenous injection of the same formulation to
 measure the “absolute bioavailability” of the drug. Bayer added an unprotected
 (normal) drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the
 enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery. Bayer expected to find
 that the enteric-coated tablet would produce a lower bioavailability than an
 intravenous injection, while the normal pill would produce an even lower
 bioavailability than the enteric-coated tablet. However, they found that despite
 observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic
 environment (supporting the belief that an enteric coating would be necessary to
 preserve bioavailability), the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill resulted in
 the same bioavailability. Following this study, Bayer developed micronized
 drospirenone in a normal pill, the basis for the disputed patent. 

The district court found that a person having
 ordinary skill in the art would have considered the prior art result that a
 structurally related compound, spirorenone, though acid-sensitive, would
 nevertheless absorb *in vivo,* would have suggested the same
 result for drospirenone. It also found that while another reference taught that
 drospirenone isomerizes *in vitro* when exposed to acid
 simulating the human stomach, a person of ordinary skill would have been aware of
 the study’s shortcomings, and would have verified the findings as suggested by a
 treatise on the science of dosage form design, which would have then showed that
 no enteric coating was necessary. 

The Federal Circuit held that the patent was invalid
 because the claimed formulation was obvious. The Federal Circuit reasoned that the
 prior art would have funneled the formulator toward two options. Thus, the
 formulator would not have been required to try all possibilities in a field
 unreduced by the prior art. The prior art was not vague in pointing toward a
 general approach or area of exploration, but rather guided the formulator
 precisely to the use of either a normal pill or an enteric-coated pill. 

It is important for Office personnel to recognize
 that the mere existence of a large number of options does not in and of itself
 lead to a conclusion of nonobviousness. Where the prior art teachings lead one of
 ordinary skill in the art to a narrower set of options, then that reduced set is
 the appropriate one to consider when determining obviousness using an obvious to
 try rationale. 

**Example 7:**

The case of *Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex,
 Inc.,* 550 F.3d 1075, 89 USPQ2d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008), also sheds
 light on the obvious to try line of reasoning. The claimed compound was
 clopidogrel, which is the dextrorotatory isomer of methyl alpha-
 5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlorophenyl)-acetate. Clopidogrel is
 an anti-thrombotic compound used to treat or prevent heart attack or stroke. The
 racemate, or mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory (D- and L-) isomers of the
 compound, was known in the prior art. The two forms had not previously been
 separated, and although the mixture was known to have anti-thrombotic properties,
 the extent to which each of the individual isomers contributed to the observed
 properties of the racemate was not known and was not predictable. 

The district court assumed that in the absence of
 any additional information, the D-isomer would have been *prima
 facie* obvious over the known racemate. However, in view of the
 evidence of unpredicted therapeutic advantages of the D-isomer presented in the
 case, the district court found that any *prima facie* case of
 obviousness had been overcome. At trial, the experts for both parties testified
 that persons of ordinary skill in the art could not have predicted the degree to
 which the isomers would have exhibited different levels of therapeutic activity
 and toxicity. Both parties’ experts also agreed that the isomer with greater
 therapeutic activity would most likely have had greater toxicity. Sanofi witnesses
 testified that Sanofi’s own researchers had believed that the separation of the
 isomers was unlikely to have been productive, and experts for both parties agreed
 that it was difficult to separate isomers at the time of the invention.
 Nevertheless, when Sanofi ultimately undertook the task of separating the isomers,
 it found that they had the “rare characteristic of ‘absolute stereoselectivity,’”
 whereby the D-isomer provided all of the favorable therapeutic activity but no
 significant toxicity, while the L-isomer produced no therapeutic activity but
 virtually all of the toxicity. Based on this record, the district court concluded
 that Apotex had not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
 that Sanofi’s patent was invalid for obviousness. The Federal Circuit affirmed the
 district court’s conclusion. 

Office personnel should recognize that even when
 only a small number of possible choices exist, the obvious to try line of
 reasoning is not appropriate when, upon consideration of all of the evidence, the
 outcome would not have been reasonably predictable and the inventor would not have
 had a reasonable expectation of success. In *Bayer,* there were
 art-based reasons to expect that both the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill
 would be therapeutically suitable, even though not all prior art studies were in
 complete agreement. Thus, the result obtained was not unexpected. In *Sanofi,* on the other hand, there was strong evidence that
 persons of ordinary skill in the art, prior to the separation of the isomers,
 would have had no reason to expect that the D-isomer would have such strong
 therapeutic advantages as compared with the L-isomer. In other words, the result
 in *Sanofi* was unexpected. 

**Example 8:**

In *Rolls-Royce, PLC v. United Tech.
 Corp.,* 603 F.3d 1325, 95 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the Federal
 Circuit addressed the obvious to try rationale in the context of a fan blade for
 jet engines. The case had arisen out of an interference proceeding. Finding that
 the district court had correctly determined that there was no interference-in-fact
 because Rolls-Royce’s claims would not have been obvious in light of United’s
 application, the Federal Circuit affirmed. 

The Federal Circuit described the fan blade of the
 count as follows: 
> Each fan blade has three regions – an inner, an
> intermediate, and an outer region. The area closest to the axis of rotation at
> the hub is the inner region. The area farthest from the center of the engine
> and closest to the casing surrounding the engine is the outer region. The
> intermediate region falls in between. The count defines a fan blade with a
> swept-forward inner region, a swept-rearward intermediate region, and
> forward-leaning outer region.

*Id.* at 1328, 95 USPQ2d at 1099. 

United had argued that it would have been obvious
 for a person of ordinary skill in the art to try a fan blade design in which the
 sweep angle in the outer region was reversed as compared with prior art fan blades
 from rearward to forward sweep, in order to reduce endwall shock. The Federal
 Circuit disagreed with United’s assessment that the claimed fan blade would have
 been obvious based on an obvious to try rationale. The Federal Circuit pointed out
 that in a proper obvious to try approach to obviousness, the possible options for
 solving a problem must have been “known and finite.” *Id.* at
 1339, 95 USPQ2d at 1107 (citing *Abbott,* 544 F.3d at 1351, 89
 USPQ2d at 1171). In this case, nothing in the prior art would have suggested that
 changing the sweep angle as Rolls-Royce had done would have addressed the issue of
 endwall shock. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that changing the sweep angle
 “would not have presented itself as an option at all, let alone an option that
 would have been obvious to try.” *Id.* The decision in *Rolls-Royce* is a reminder to Office personnel that the
 obvious to try rationale can properly be used to support a conclusion of
 obviousness only when the claimed solution would have been selected from a finite
 number of potential solutions known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. 

**Example 9:**

The case of *Perfect Web Tech., Inc. v.
 InfoUSA, Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1328-29, 92 USPQ2d 1849, 1854 (Fed.
 Cir. 2009), provides an example in which the Federal Circuit held that a claimed
 method for managing bulk email distribution was obvious on the basis of an obvious
 to try argument. In *Perfect Web,* the method required selecting
 the intended recipients, transmitting the emails, determining how many of the
 emails had been successfully received, and repeating the first three steps if a
 pre-determined minimum number of intended recipients had not received the email. 

The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s
 determination on summary judgment that the claimed invention would have been
 obvious. Failure to meet a desired quota of email recipients was a recognized
 problem in the field of email marketing. The prior art had also recognized three
 potential solutions: increasing the size of the initial recipient list; resending
 emails to recipients who did not receive them on the first attempt; and selecting
 a new recipient list and sending emails to them. The last option corresponded to
 the fourth step of the invention as claimed. 

The Federal Circuit noted that based on “simple
 logic,” selecting a new list of recipients was more likely to result in the
 desired outcome than resending to those who had not received the email on the
 first attempt. There had been no evidence of any unexpected result associated with
 selecting a new recipient list, and no evidence that the method would not have had
 a reasonable likelihood of success. Thus, the Federal Circuit concluded that, as
 required by *KSR,* there were a “finite number of identified,
 predictable solutions,” and that the obvious to try inquiry properly led to the
 legal conclusion of obviousness. 

The Federal Circuit in *Perfect
 Web* also discussed the role of common sense in the determination of
 obviousness. The district court had cited *KSR* for the
 proposition that “[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary
 creativity, not an automaton,” and found that “the final step [of the claimed
 invention] is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim
 ‘try, try again.’” In affirming the district court, the Federal Circuit undertook
 an extended discussion of common sense as it has been applied to the obviousness
 inquiry, both before and since the *KSR* decision. 

The Federal Circuit pointed out that application of
 common sense is not really an innovation in the law of obviousness when it stated,
 “Common sense has long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness if
 explained with sufficient reasoning.” *Perfect Web,* 587 F.3d at
 1328, 92 USPQ2d at 1853 (emphasis added). The Federal Circuit then provided a
 review of a number of precedential cases that inform the understanding of common
 sense, including *In re Bozek,* 416 F.2d 1385, 1390, 163 USPQ
 545, 549 (CCPA 1969) (explaining that a patent examiner may rely on “common
 knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any
 specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference”) and *In re
 Zurko,* 258 F.3d 1379, 1383, 1385, 59 USPQ2d 1693 at 1695, 1697 (Fed.
 Cir. 2001) (clarifying that a factual foundation is needed in order for an
 examiner to invoke “good common sense” in a case in which “basic knowledge and
 common sense was not based on any evidence in the record”). The Federal Circuit
 implicitly acknowledged in *Perfect Web* that the kind of strict
 evidence-based teaching, suggestion, or motivation required in *In re
 Lee,* 277 F.3d 1338, 1344, 61 USPQ2d 1430, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2002), is
 not an absolute requirement for an obviousness rejection in light of the teachings
 of *KSR.* The Federal Circuit explained that “[a]t the time [of
 the Lee decision], we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching,
 suggestion, or motivation to combine references.” However, *Perfect
 Web* went on to state that even under *Lee,* common
 sense could properly be applied when analyzing evidence relevant to obviousness.
 Citing *DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
 1356, 80 USPQ2d 1641 (Fed. Cir. 2006), and *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d
 977, 78 USPQ2d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006), two cases decided shortly before the Supreme
 Court’s decision in *KSR,* the Federal Circuit noted that
 although “a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations” is
 required to use common sense, identification of a “specific hint or suggestion in
 a particular reference” is not. See also *B/E Aerospace, Inc. v. C&D
 Zodiac, Inc.,* 962 F.3d 1373, 1380-81, 2020 USPQ2d 10706 (Fed. Cir.
 2020) (stating that “the Board’s invocation of common sense was properly
 accompanied by reasoned analysis and evidentiary support” to show why it would be
 obvious to incorporate a second recess to receive an airplane seat support). But
 see *Arendi v. Apple,* 832 F.3d 1355, 119 USPQ2d 1822 (Fed. Cir.
 2016) (finding that the Board had not provided a reasoned analysis, supported by
 the evidence of record, for why “common sense” taught the missing process step). 

***F.******Known Work in One Field of Endeavor May Prompt Variations of It for Use
 in Either the Same Field or a Different One Based on Design Incentives or Other
 Market Forces if the Variations Are Predictable to One of Ordinary Skill in the
 Art***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that the scope and content of the prior art, whether
 in the same field of endeavor as that of the applicant’s invention or a
 different field of endeavor, included a similar or analogous device (method, or
 product);
- (2) a finding that there were design incentives or market forces
 which would have prompted adaptation of the known device (method, or product);
- (3) a finding that the differences between the claimed invention
 and the prior art were encompassed in known variations or in a principle known
 in the prior art;
- (4) a finding that one of ordinary skill in the art, in view of
 the identified design incentives or other market forces, could have implemented
 the claimed variation of the prior art, and the claimed variation would have
 been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art; and
- (5) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claimed invention
 would have been obvious is that design incentives or other market forces could have
 prompted one of ordinary skill in the art to vary the prior art in a predictable
 manner to result in the claimed invention. If any of these findings cannot be made,
 then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

**Example 1:**

The fact pattern in *Dann v. Johnston,* 425 U.S.
 219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) is set forth above in Example 1 in subsection D. 

The Court found that the problem addressed by applicant – the
 need to give more detailed breakdown by a category of transactions – was closely
 analogous to the task of keeping track of the transaction files of individual
 business units. *Id.* at 229, 189 USPQ at 261. Thus, an artisan
 in the data processing area would have recognized the similar class of problem and
 the known solutions of the prior art and it would have been well within the
 ordinary skill level to implement the system in the different environment. The
 Court held that “[t]he gap between the prior art and respondent’s system is simply
 not so great as to render the system nonobvious to one reasonably skilled in the
 art.”  *Id.* at 230, 189 USPQ at 261. 

**Example 2:**

The claimed invention in *Leapfrog Enterprises, Inc. v.
 Fisher-Price, Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 82 USPQ2d 1687 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
 was directed to a learning device to help young children read phonetically. The
 claim read as follows: 

An interactive learning device, comprising:

a housing including a plurality of switches;

a sound production device in communication with the switches and
 including a processor and a memory; 

at least one depiction of a sequence of letters, each letter
 being associable with a switch; and 

a reader configured to communicate the identity of the depiction
 to the processor, 

wherein selection of a depicted letter activates an associated
 switch to communicate with the processor, causing the sound production device to
 generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter,
 the sound being determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of
 letter. 

The court concluded that the claimed invention would have been
 obvious in view of the combination of two pieces of prior art, (1) Bevan (which
 showed an electro-mechanical toy for phonetic learning), (2) the Super Speak &
 Read device (SSR) (an electronic reading toy), and the knowledge of one of
 ordinary skill in the art. 

The court made clear that there was no technological advance
 beyond the skill shown in the SSR device. The court stated that “one of ordinary
 skill in the art of children’s learning toys would have found it obvious to
 combine the Bevan device with the SSR to update it using modern electronic
 components in order to gain the commonly understood benefits of such adaptation,
 such as decreased size, increased reliability, simplified operation, and reduced
 cost. While the SSR only permits generation of a sound corresponding to the first
 letter of a word, it does so using electronic means. The combination is thus the
 adaptation of an old idea or invention (Bevan) using newer technology that is
 commonly available and understood in the art (the SSR).” 

The court found that the claimed invention was but a variation on
 already known children’s toys. This variation presented no nonobvious advance over
 other toys. The court made clear that there was no technological advance beyond
 the skill shown in the SSR device. The court found that “[a]ccommodating a prior
 art mechanical device that accomplishes that goal to modern electronics would have
 been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary skill in designing children’s learning
 devices. Applying modern electronics to older mechanical devices has been
 commonplace in recent years.” 

**Example 3:**

The claimed invention in *KSR Int'l Co. v.
 Teleflex**Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007), was an adjustable
 pedal assembly with a fixed pivot point and an electronic pedal-position sensor
 attached to the assembly support. The fixed pivot point meant that the pivot was
 not changed as the pedal was adjusted. The placement of the sensor on the assembly
 support kept the sensor fixed while the pedal was adjusted. 

Conventional gas pedals operated by a mechanical link which
 adjusted the throttle based on the travel of the pedal from a set position. The
 throttle controlled the combustion process and the available power generated by
 the engine. Newer cars used computer controlled throttles in which a sensor
 detected the motion of the pedal and sent signals to the engine to adjust the
 throttle accordingly. At the time of the invention, the marketplace provided a
 strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior
 art taught a number of methods for doing so. The prior art (Asano) taught an
 adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point with mechanical throttle control. The
 prior art (‘936 patent to Byler) taught an electronic pedal sensor which was
 placed on a pivot point in the pedal assembly and that it was preferable to detect
 the pedal’s position in the pedal mechanism rather than in the engine. The prior
 art (Smith) taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer
 from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the
 pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedal’s footpad. The prior art (Rixon)
 taught an adjustable pedal assembly (sensor in the footpad) with an electronic
 sensor for throttle control. There was no prior art electronic throttle control
 that was combined with a pedal assembly which kept the pivot point fixed when
 adjusting the pedal. 

The Court stated that “[t]he proper question to have asked was
 whether a pedal designer of ordinary skill, facing the wide range of needs created
 by developments in the field of endeavor, would have seen a benefit to upgrading
 Asano with a sensor.” *Id.* at 424, 82 USPQ2d at 1399. The Court
 found that technological developments in the automotive design would have prompted
 a designer to upgrade Asano with an electronic sensor. The next question was where
 to attach the sensor. Based on the prior art, a designer would have known to place
 the sensor on a nonmoving part of the pedal structure and the most obvious
 nonmoving point on the structure from which a sensor can easily detect the pedal’s
 position was a pivot point. The Court concluded that it would have been obvious to
 upgrade Asano’s fixed pivot point adjustable pedal by replacing the mechanical
 assembly for throttle control with an electronic throttle control and to mount the
 electronic sensor on the pedal support structure. 

**Example 4:**

The claimed invention in *Ex parte Catan,* 83
 USPQ2d 1569 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2007), was a consumer electronics device
 using bioauthentication to authorize sub-users of an authorized credit account to
 place orders over a communication network up to a pre-set maximum sub-credit
 limit. 

The prior art (Nakano) disclosed a consumer electronics device
 like the claimed invention, except that security was provided by a password
 authentication device rather than a bioauthentication device. The prior art
 (Harada) disclosed that the use of a bioauthentication device (fingerprint sensor)
 on a consumer electronics device (remote control) to provide bioauthentication
 information (fingerprint) was known in the prior art at the time of the invention.
 The prior art (Dethloff) also disclosed that it was known in the art at the time
 of the invention to substitute bioauthentication for PIN authentication to enable
 a user to access credit via a consumer electronics device. 

The Board found that the prior art “shows that one of ordinary
 skill in the consumer electronic device art at the time of the invention would
 have been familiar with using bioauthentication information interchangeably with
 or in lieu of PINs to authenticate users.” The Board concluded that one of
 ordinary skill in the art of consumer electronic devices would have found it
 obvious to update the prior art password device with the modern bioauthentication
 component and thereby gain, predictably, the commonly understood benefits of such
 adaptation, that is, a secure and reliable authentication procedure. 

***G.******Some Teaching, Suggestion, or Motivation in the Prior Art That Would Have
 Led One of Ordinary Skill To Modify the Prior Art Reference or To Combine Prior
 Art Reference Teachings To Arrive at the Claimed Invention***

To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must
 resolve the *Graham* factual inquiries. Then, Office personnel must
 articulate the following: 

- (1) a finding that there was some teaching, suggestion, or
 motivation, either in the references themselves or in the knowledge generally
 available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the reference or to
 combine reference teachings;
- (2) a finding that there was reasonable expectation of success;
 and
- (3) whatever additional findings based on the *Graham* factual inquiries may be necessary, in view of the
 facts of the case under consideration, to explain a conclusion of obviousness.


The rationale to support a conclusion that the claim would have
 been obvious is that "a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated
 to combine the prior art to achieve the claimed invention and whether there would
 have been a reasonable expectation of success in doing so."  *DyStar
 Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG v. C.H. Patrick Co.,* 464 F.3d
 1356, 1360, 80 USPQ2d 1641, 1645 (Fed. Cir. 2006). If any of these findings cannot be
 made, then this rationale cannot be used to support a conclusion that the claim would
 have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. 

The courts have made clear that the teaching, suggestion, or
 motivation test is flexible and an explicit suggestion to combine the prior art is
 not necessary. The motivation to combine may be implicit and may be found in the
 knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, or, in some cases, from the nature of
 the problem to be solved. *Id.* at 1366, 80 USPQ2d at 1649. “[A]n
 implicit motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from
 the prior art as a whole, but when the ‘improvement’ is technology-independent and
 the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable,
 for example because it is stronger, cheaper, cleaner, faster, lighter, smaller, more
 durable, or more efficient. Because the desire to enhance commercial opportunities by
 improving a product or process is universal—and even common-sensical—we have held
 that there exists in these situations a motivation to combine prior art references
 even absent any hint of suggestion in the references themselves. In such situations,
 the proper question is whether the ordinary artisan possesses knowledge and skills
 rendering him *capable* of combining the prior art references.”  *Id.* at 1368, 80 USPQ2d at 1651. 

# 2143.01 Suggestion or Motivation To Modify the References [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable
 regardless of whether an application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law.
 For applications subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA,
 the relevant time is "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For

Obviousness can be established by combining or modifying the teachings
 of the prior art to produce the claimed invention where there is some teaching,
 suggestion, or motivation to do so. *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 986, 78
 USPQ2d 1329, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (discussing rationale underlying the
 motivation-suggestion-teaching test as a guard against using hindsight in an obviousness
 analysis). *Axonics, Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc.,* 73 F.4th 950, 957-58,
 2023 USPQ2d 795 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (the court found an erroneous framing of the motivation
 inquiry led to an incorrect conclusion of nonobviousness). A “motivation to combine may
 be found explicitly or implicitly in market forces; design incentives; the ‘interrelated
 teachings of multiple patents’; ‘any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at
 the time of invention and addressed by the patent’; and the background knowledge,
 creativity, and common sense of the person of ordinary skill.” *Zup v. Nash
 Mfg.,* 896 F.3d 1365, 1371, 127 USPQ2d 1423, 1427 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting *Plantronics, Inc. v. Aliph, Inc.,* 724 F.3d 1343, 1354 [107 USPQ2d
 1706] (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing *Perfect Web Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA,
 Inc.,* 587 F.3d 1324, 1328 [92 USPQ2d 1849] (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418-21)). See **[MPEP § 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)** regarding
 the need to provide a reasoned explanation even in situations involving common sense or
 ordinary ingenuity. See also **[MPEP § 2144.05](s2144.html#d0e211255)**, subsection II, B. 

**I.** **PRIOR ART SUGGESTION OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION NOT NECESSARILY NEGATED BY
 DESIRABLE ALTERNATIVES**

The disclosure of desirable alternatives does not necessarily negate
 a suggestion for modifying the prior art to arrive at the claimed invention. In *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 73 USPQ2d 1141 (Fed. Cir. 2004),
 the claims of a utility patent application were directed to a shoe sole with
 increased traction having hexagonal projections in a “facing orientation.” 391 F.3d
 at 1196-97, 73 USPQ2d at 1142. The Board combined a design patent having hexagonal
 projections in a facing orientation with a utility patent having other limitations of
 the independent claim. 391 F.3d at 1199, 73 USPQ2d at 1144. Applicant argued that the
 combination was improper because (1) the prior art did not suggest having the
 hexagonal projections in a facing (as opposed to a “pointing”) orientation was the
 “most desirable” configuration for the projections, and (2) the prior art “taught
 away” by showing desirability of the “pointing orientation.” 391 F.3d at 1200-01, 73
 USPQ2d at 1145-46. The court stated that “the prior art’s mere disclosure of more
 than one alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these
 alternatives because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise
 discourage the solution claimed….” *Id.* In affirming the Board’s
 obviousness rejection, the court held that the prior art as a whole suggested the
 desirability of the combination of shoe sole limitations claimed, thus providing a
 motivation to combine, which need not be supported by a finding that the prior art
 suggested that the combination claimed by the applicant was the preferred, or most
 desirable combination over the other alternatives. *Id.* See also *In re Urbanski,* 809 F.3d 1237, 1244, 117 USPQ2d 1499, 1504
 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

In *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270,
 69 USPQ2d 1686 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the patent claimed underpinning a slumping building
 foundation using a screw anchor attached to the foundation by a metal bracket. One
 prior art reference taught a screw anchor with a concrete bracket, and a second prior
 art reference disclosed a pier anchor with a metal bracket. The court found
 motivation to combine the references to arrive at the claimed invention in the
 “nature of the problem to be solved” because each reference was directed “to
 precisely the same problem of underpinning slumping foundations.” *Id.* at 1276, 69 USPQ2d at 1690. The court also *rejected* the notion that “an express written motivation to
 combine must appear in prior art references….” *Id.* at 1276, 69
 USPQ2d at 1690. 

**II.** **WHERE THE TEACHINGS OF THE PRIOR ART CONFLICT, THE EXAMINER MUST WEIGH THE
 SUGGESTIVE POWER OF EACH REFERENCE**

The test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the
 references would have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art, and all
 teachings in the prior art must be considered to the extent that they are in
 analogous arts. Where the teachings of two or more prior art references conflict, the
 examiner must weigh the power of each reference to suggest solutions to one of
 ordinary skill in the art, considering the degree to which one reference might
 accurately discredit another. *In re Young,* 927 F.2d 588, 18 USPQ2d
 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Prior art patent to Carlisle disclosed controlling and
 minimizing bubble oscillation for chemical explosives used in marine seismic
 exploration by spacing seismic sources close enough to allow the bubbles to intersect
 before reaching their maximum radius so the secondary pressure pulse was reduced. An
 article published several years later by Knudsen opined that the Carlisle technique
 did not yield appreciable improvement in bubble oscillation suppression. However, the
 article did not test the Carlisle technique under comparable conditions because
 Knudsen did not use Carlisle’s spacing or seismic source. Furthermore, where the
 Knudsen model most closely approximated the patent technique there was a 30%
 reduction of the secondary pressure pulse. On these facts, the court found that the
 Knudsen article would not have deterred one of ordinary skill in the art from using
 the Carlisle patent teachings.). 

**III.** **FACT THAT REFERENCES CAN BE COMBINED OR MODIFIED MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
 ESTABLISH *PRIMA FACIE* OBVIOUSNESS**

The mere fact that references can be combined
 or modified does not render the resultant combination obvious unless the results
 would have been predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art. *KSR Int'l
 Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 417, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007)
 (“If a person of ordinary skill can implement a predictable variation, **[§
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** likely bars its patentability. For the same reason, if a
 technique has been used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the
 art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the
 technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill.”). 

**IV.** **MERE STATEMENT THAT THE CLAIMED INVENTION IS WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF ONE OF
 ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART IS NOT SUFFICIENT BY ITSELF TO ESTABLISH *PRIMA
 FACIE* OBVIOUSNESS**

A statement that modifications of the prior art to meet the claimed
 invention would have been “‘well within the ordinary skill of the
 art at the time the claimed invention was made’” because the
 references relied upon teach that all aspects of the claimed invention were
 individually known in the art is not sufficient to establish a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness without some objective reason to combine the
 teachings of the references. *Ex parte Levengood,* 28 USPQ2d 1300
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993). ‘‘‘[R]ejections on obviousness cannot be sustained
 by mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with
 some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.’” *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (quoting *In re
 Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). 

**V.** **THE PROPOSED MODIFICATION CANNOT RENDER THE PRIOR ART UNSATISFACTORY FOR ITS
 INTENDED PURPOSE**

If a proposed modification would render the prior art invention
 being modified unsatisfactory for its intended purpose, there may be no suggestion or
 motivation to make the proposed modification. *In re Gordon,* 733
 F.2d 900, 221 USPQ 1125 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Claimed device was a blood filter assembly
 for use during medical procedures wherein both the inlet and outlet for the blood
 were located at the bottom end of the filter assembly, and wherein a gas vent was
 present at the top of the filter assembly. The prior art reference taught a liquid
 strainer for removing dirt and water from gasoline and other light oils wherein the
 inlet and outlet were at the top of the device, and wherein a pet-cock (stopcock) was
 located at the bottom of the device for periodically removing the collected dirt and
 water. The reference further taught that the separation is assisted by gravity. The
 Board concluded the claims were *prima facie* obvious, reasoning
 that it would have been obvious to turn the reference device upside down. The court
 reversed, finding that if the prior art device were turned upside down it would be
 inoperable for its intended purpose because the gasoline to be filtered would be
 trapped at the top, the water and heavier oils sought to be separated would flow out
 of the outlet instead of the purified gasoline, and the screen would become
 clogged.). But see *In re Urbanski,* 809 F.3d 1237, 1244, 117 USPQ2d
 1499, 1504 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (The patent claims were directed to a method of enzymatic
 hydrolysis of soy fiber to reduce water holding capacity, requiring reacting the soy
 fiber and enzyme in water for about 60-120 minutes. The claims were rejected over two
 prior art references, wherein the primary reference taught using a longer reaction
 time of 5 to 72 hours and the secondary reference taught using a reaction time of 100
 to 240 minutes, preferably 120 minutes. The applicant argued that modifying the
 primary reference in the manner suggested by the secondary reference would forego the
 benefits taught by the primary reference, thereby teaching away from the combination.
 The court held that both prior art references “suggest[ed] that hydrolysis time may
 be adjusted to achieve *different* fiber properties. Nothing in the
 prior art teaches that the proposed modification would have resulted in an
 ‘inoperable’ process or a dietary fiber product with undesirable properties.”
 (emphasis in original)). 

“Although statements limiting the function or capability of a prior
 art device require fair consideration, simplicity of the prior art is rarely a
 characteristic that weighs against obviousness of a more complicated device with
 added function.” *In re Dance,* 160 F.3d 1339, 1344, 48 USPQ2d 1635,
 1638 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Court held that claimed catheter for removing obstruction in
 blood vessels would have been obvious in view of a first reference which taught all
 of the claimed elements except for a “means for recovering fluid and debris” in
 combination with a second reference describing a catheter including that means. The
 court agreed that the first reference, which stressed simplicity of structure and
 taught emulsification of the debris, did not teach away from the addition of a
 channel for the recovery of the debris.). Similarly, in *Allied Erecting v.
 Genesis Attachments,* 825 F.3d 1373, 1381, 119 USPQ2d 1132, 1138 (Fed.
 Cir. 2016), the court stated “[a]lthough modification of the movable blades may
 impede the quick change functionality disclosed by Caterpillar, ‘[a] given course of
 action often has simultaneous advantages and disadvantages, and this does not
 necessarily obviate motivation to combine’” (quoting *Medichem, S.A. v.
 Rolabo, S.L.,* 437 F.3d 1157, 1165, 77 USPQ2d 1865, 1870 (Fed. Cir. 2006)
 (citation omitted)). 

**VI.** **THE PROPOSED MODIFICATION CANNOT CHANGE THE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF A
 REFERENCE**

If the proposed modification or combination of the prior art would
 change the principle of operation of the prior art invention being modified, then the
 teachings of the references are not sufficient to render the claims *prima
 facie* obvious. *In re Ratti,* 270 F.2d 810, 813, 123
 USPQ 349, 352 (CCPA 1959) (Claims were directed to an oil seal comprising a bore
 engaging portion with outwardly biased resilient spring fingers inserted in a
 resilient sealing member. The primary reference relied upon in a rejection based on a
 combination of references disclosed an oil seal wherein the bore engaging portion was
 reinforced by a cylindrical sheet metal casing. The seal construction taught in the
 primary reference required rigidity for operation, whereas the seal in the claimed
 invention required resiliency. The court reversed the rejection holding the
 “suggested combination of references would require a substantial reconstruction and
 redesign of the elements shown in [the primary reference] as well as a change in the
 basic principle under which the [primary reference] construction was designed to
 operate.”).

 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court decisions may be applicable to
 applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the
 relevant time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at
 the time of the invention.]*

**I.** **OBVIOUSNESS REQUIRES A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS**

Where there is a reason to modify or combine the prior art to
 achieve the claimed invention, the claims may be rejected as *prima
 facie* obvious provided there is also a reasonable expectation of
 success. The reasonable expectation of success requirement refers to “the likelihood
 of success” in combining or modifying prior art disclosures to meet the limitations
 of the claimed invention. See *Elekta Ltd. v. ZAP Surgical Sys.,
 Inc.,* 81 F.4th 1368, 1375, 2023 USPQ2d 1100 (Fed. Cir. 2023) and *Intelligent Bio-Sys., Inc. v. Illumina Cambridge Ltd.,* 821 F.3d
 1359, 1367, 119 USPQ2d 1171, 1176 (Fed. Cir. 2016). See **[MPEP § 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)** for
 guidance on rationales for modifying or combining the prior art. In *In re
 Merck & Co., Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the
 Board affirmed a rejection of claims directed to a method of treating depression with
 amitriptyline (or nontoxic salts thereof) as *prima facie* obvious.
 The prior art disclosed that amitriptyline is a compound known to possess
 psychotropic properties and that imipramine is a structurally similar psychotropic
 compound known to possess antidepressive properties. Additional prior art, suggested
 that these compounds would have been expected to have similar activity because the
 structural difference between them involved a known bioisosteric replacement, and
 because a research paper comparing the pharmacological properties of these two
 compounds suggested clinical testing of amitriptyline as an antidepressant. The court
 affirmed the Board’s determination, finding that the teachings of the prior art
 provided a sufficient basis for a reasonable expectation of success.) In *Ex
 parte Blanc,* 13 USPQ2d 1383 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) (the
 claims were directed to a process of sterilizing a polyolefinic composition with
 high-energy radiation in the presence of a phenolic polyester antioxidant to inhibit
 discoloration or degradation of the polyolefin. Appellant argued that it is
 unpredictable whether a particular antioxidant will solve the problem of
 discoloration or degradation. However, the Board found that because the prior art
 taught that appellant’s preferred antioxidant is very efficient and provides better
 results compared with other prior art antioxidants, there would have been a
 reasonable expectation of success.). 

As discussed above, reasonable expectation of success
 can be implicitly shown via the prior art teachings or as part of the obviousness
 analysis. See *Elekta Ltd. v. ZAP Surgical Sys., Inc.,* 81 F.4th
 1368, 1376-77, 2023 USPQ2d 1100 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (“[W]e can reasonably discern that
 the Board considered and implicitly addressed reasonable expectation of success based
 on the arguments and evidence presented to the Board on motivation to combine.”). In
 this decision, the court found the Board’s explanation on why the patent owner's
 arguments and evidence presented on motivation to combine were not persuasive
 implicitly addressed reasonable expectation of success and was supported by
 substantial evidence. On the other hand, depending on the situation (e.g., the
 technology, the prior art teachings and the obviousness analysis), reliance on an
 implicit showing of reasonable expectation of success may not be sufficient to
 establish a *prima facie* showing of obviousness. *Eli Lilly
 & Co. v. Teva Pharms. Int’l GmbH,* 8 F.4th 1331, 1344, 2021 USPQ2d
 862 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (A finding that a patent challenger in an *inter
 partes* review had demonstrated a motivation to combine references does
 not necessarily imply that the challenger had also met its burden of showing a
 reasonable expectation of success in achieving a claimed method of treatment.). In
 this case, the court found that the challenged method of treating claims “contain
 limitations related to their intended purpose for treating vasomotor symptoms [as
 stated in the preamble], and thus those limitations are undoubtedly relevant to the
 reasonable expectation of success.” *Id.* at 1345. In other words,
 the court found that the preamble was limiting and applicable to reasonable
 expectation of success. However, the limitations in the preamble were not addressed
 in the motivation to combine analysis. Any obviousness rejection should include,
 either explicitly or implicitly, an indication of a reasonable expectation of
 success. 

Conclusive proof of efficacy is not required to show
 a reasonable expectation of success. *OSI Pharm., LLC v. Apotex
 Inc.,* 939 F.3d 1375, 1385, 2019 USPQ2d 379681 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“To be
 clear, we do not hold today that efficacy data is always required for a reasonable
 expectation of success. Nor are we requiring ‘absolute predictability of success.’”); *Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. v. Roxane Lab., Inc.,* 903 F.3d 1310,
 1333, 128 USPQ2d 1001, 1018 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (“This court has long rejected a
 requirement of ‘[c]onclusive proof of efficacy’ for obviousness.” (citing to *Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Apotex Inc.,* 748 F.3d 1326, 1331
 (Fed. Cir. 2014); *PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, Inc.,* 491 F.3d 1342, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2007); *Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex,
 Inc.,* 480 F.3d 1348, 1364, 1367–68 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (reasoning that “the
 expectation of success need only be reasonable, not absolute”)). 

**II.** **AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF PREDICTABILITY IS REQUIRED; APPLICANTS MAY PRESENT
 EVIDENCE SHOWING THERE WAS NO REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS**

Obviousness does not require absolute predictability, but at least
 some degree of predictability is required. Evidence showing there was no reasonable
 expectation of success may support a conclusion of nonobviousness. *In re
 Rinehart,* 531 F.2d 1048, 189 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1976) (Claims directed to a
 method for the commercial scale production of polyesters in the presence of a solvent
 at superatmospheric pressure were rejected as obvious over a reference which taught
 the claimed method at atmospheric pressure in view of a reference which taught the
 claimed process except for the presence of a solvent. The court reversed, finding
 there was no reasonable expectation that a process combining the prior art steps
 could be successfully scaled up in view of unchallenged evidence showing that the
 prior art processes individually could not be commercially scaled up successfully.).
 See also *OSI Pharm., LLC v. Apotex Inc.,* 939 F.3d 1375, 1385, 2019
 USPQ2d 379681 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“These references provide no more than hope—and hope
 that a potentially promising drug will treat a particular cancer is not enough to
 create a reasonable expectation of success in a highly unpredictable art such as
 this. Indeed, given a 99.5% failure rate and no efficacy data or any other reliable
 indicator of success, the only reasonable expectation at the time of the invention
 was failure, not success.”); *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm. Co.,* 927
 F.2d 1200, 1207-08, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1022-23 (Fed. Cir. 1991), *cert.
 denied,* 502 U.S. 856 (1991) (In the context of a biotechnology case,
 testimony supported the conclusion that the references did not show that there was a
 reasonable expectation of success.); *In re O’Farrell,* 853 F.2d
 894, 903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (The court held the claimed method
 would have been obvious over the prior art relied upon because one reference
 contained a detailed enabling methodology, a suggestion to modify the prior art to
 produce the claimed invention, and evidence suggesting the modification would be
 successful.). 

**III.** **PREDICTABILITY IS DETERMINED AT THE RELEVANT TIME**

Whether an art is predictable or whether the proposed modification
 or combination of the prior art has a reasonable expectation of success is determined
 at the time the invention was made for pre-AIA obviousness analysis. *Ex
 parte Erlich,* 3 USPQ2d 1011, 1016 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986)
 (Although an earlier case reversed a rejection because of unpredictability in the
 field of monoclonal antibodies, the court found “in this case at the time this invention was made, one of ordinary skill in
 the art would have been motivated to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for human
 fibroplast interferon using the method of [the prior art] with a reasonable
 expectation of success.”) (emphasis in original). For obviousness analysis under the
 AIA, the relevant time is “before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention.” 

# 2143.03 All Claim Limitations Must Be Considered [R-01.2024]

“All words in a claim must be considered in judging the patentability
 of that claim against the prior art.” *In re Wilson,* 424 F.2d 1382,
 1385, 165 USPQ 494, 496 (CCPA 1970). 

Examiners must consider all claim limitations when
 determining patentability of an invention over the prior art. *In re
 Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The
 subject matter of a properly construed claim is defined by the terms that limit the
 scope of the claim when given their broadest reasonable interpretation. In *Axonics, Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc.,* 73 F.4th 950, 958-59, 2023
 USPQ2d 795 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the court found the claims were improperly narrowed based
 on a preferred embodiment to sacral anatomy or sacral neuromodulation, whereas the
 patent claims made no reference to sacral anatomy or sacral neuromodulation. Thus, the
 relevant prior art was improperly limited to a narrow subset of claim scope. See also **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)***et seq.* It is the subject matter of the properly construed claim that
 must be examined. The determination of whether particular language is a limitation in a
 claim depends on the specific facts of the case. See, e.g., *Griffin v.
 Bertina,* 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002). 

As a general matter, the grammar and ordinary meaning of
 terms as understood by one having ordinary skill in the art used in a claim will dictate
 whether, and to what extent, the language limits the claim scope. Language that suggests
 or makes a feature or step optional but does not require that feature or step does not
 limit the scope of a claim under the broadest reasonable claim interpretation. In
 addition, when a claim requires selection of an element from a list of alternatives, the
 prior art teaches the element if one of the alternatives is taught by the prior art.
 See, e.g., *Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int’l, Inc.,* 582 F.3d 1288,
 1298, 92 USPQ2d 1163, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

The following types of claim language may raise a
 question as to its limiting effect (this list is not exhaustive): 

- • preamble (**[MPEP § 2111.02](s2111.html#d0e200689)**);
- • clauses such as “adapted to,” adapted for,”
 “wherein,” and “whereby” (**[MPEP § 2111.04](s2111.html#d0e201000)**, subsection I);
- • contingent limitations (**[MPEP § 2111.04](s2111.html#d0e201000)**,
 subsection II);
- • printed matter (**[MPEP §
 2111.05](s2111.html#ch2100_d1b148_1ea0c_2c0)**); and
- • functional language associated with a claim term
 (**[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**).


If an independent claim is nonobvious under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, then any claim depending therefrom is nonobvious. *In
 re Fine,* 837 F.2d 1071, 5 USPQ2d 1596 (Fed. Cir. 1988). However, this
 conclusion of the *Fine* court may not apply if a claim is not properly
 dependent or if the effective filing date of a dependent claim is later than the
 effective filing date of an independent claim from which the dependent claim depends.
 See **[MPEP §
 608.01(n)](s608.html#d0e45256)** for a discussion of dependent claims and **[MPEP §
 2133.01](s2133.html#d0e203726)** and **[§
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** for a discussion of effective filing date of a claimed
 invention determined on a claim-by-claim basis. 

**I.** **INDEFINITE LIMITATIONS MUST BE CONSIDERED**

A claim limitation which is considered indefinite cannot be
 disregarded. If a claim is subject to more than one interpretation, at least one of
 which would render the claim unpatentable over the prior art, the examiner should
 reject the claim as indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph (see **[MPEP §
 2175](s2175.html#ch2100_d2c184_13a97_15)**) and should reject the claim
 over the prior art based on the interpretation of the claim that renders the prior
 art applicable. *Ex parte Ionescu,* 222 USPQ 537 (Bd. Pat. App.
 & Inter. 1984) (Claims on appeal were rejected on indefiniteness grounds only;
 the rejection was reversed and the case remanded to the examiner for consideration of
 pertinent prior art.). Making both rejections, when appropriate, avoids piecemeal
 appellate review. See *Ionescu,* 222 USPQ at 540 n.9 (citing CCPA
 and Federal Circuit cases.). See also *In re Wilson,* 424 F.2d 1382,
 165 USPQ 494 (CCPA 1970) (The Board erred because it ignored claim language that it
 considered to be indefinite, and reached a conclusion that the claim would have been
 obvious based only on the rest of the claim.). However, an examiner should not simply
 speculate about the meaning of the claim language and then enter an obviousness
 rejection in view of that speculative interpretation. *In re
 Steele,* 305 F.2d 859,134 USPQ 292 (CCPA 1962) (The “considerable
 speculation” by the examiner and the Board as to the scope of the claims did not
 provide a proper basis for an obviousness rejection.). A claim should not be rejected
 over prior art just because it is indefinite. *Ionescu,* 222 USPQ at
 540 (citing *Steele*). Although a claim that is indefinite because
 it is susceptible to more than one interpretation may be rejected over prior art, an
 examiner should not base a prior art rejection on a claim interpretation that is not
 reasonable; see **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** regarding proper claim interpretation. 

**II.** **LIMITATIONS WHICH DO NOT FIND SUPPORT IN THE ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION MUST BE
 CONSIDERED**

When evaluating claims for obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**,
 all the limitations of the claims must be considered and given weight, including
 limitations which do not find support in the specification as originally filed (i.e.,
 new matter). *Ex parte Grasselli,* 231 USPQ 393 (Bd. App. 1983) *aff’d mem.* 738 F.2d 453 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Claim to a catalyst
 expressly excluded the presence of sulfur, halogen, uranium, and a combination of
 vanadium and phosphorous. Although the negative limitations excluding these elements
 did not appear in the specification as filed, it was error to disregard these
 limitations when determining whether the claimed invention would have been obvious in
 view of the prior art.). “All words in a claim must be considered in judging the
 patentability of that claim against the prior art.” *In re Miller,* 441 F.2d 689, 694, 169 USPQ 597, 600 (CCPA 1971) (quoting *In re
 Wilson,* 424 F.2d 1382, 1385, 165 USPQ 494, 496 (CCPA 1970)).

# 2144 Supporting a Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. 103 [R-01.2024]

When considering obviousness, Office personnel are cautioned
 against treating any line of reasoning as a *per se* rule. This section
 discusses supporting a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** by reliance on scientific
 theory and legal precedent. In keeping with the flexible approach to obviousness under *KSR,* as well as the requirement for explanation, Office personnel may
 invoke legal precedent as a source of supporting rationale when warranted and appropriately
 supported. See **[MPEP §
 2144.04](s2144.html#d0e210929)**. So, for example, automating a manual activity, making
 portable, making separable, reversing or duplicating parts, or purifying an old product may
 form the basis of a rejection. However, such rationales should not be treated as *per se* rules, but rather must be explained and shown to apply to the
 facts at hand. A similar caveat applies to any obviousness analysis. Simply stating the
 principle (e.g., “art recognized equivalent,” “structural similarity”) without providing an
 explanation of its applicability to the facts of the case at hand is generally not
 sufficient to establish a *prima facie* case of obviousness. 

**I.** **RATIONALE MAY BE IN A REFERENCE, OR REASONED FROM COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN THE ART,
 SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES, ART-RECOGNIZED EQUIVALENTS, OR LEGAL PRECEDENT**

The rationale to modify or combine the prior art does not have to be
 expressly stated in the prior art; the rationale may be expressly or impliedly contained
 in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available to one of
 ordinary skill in the art, established scientific principles, or legal precedent
 established by prior case law. *In re Fine,* 837 F.2d 1071, 5 USPQ2d
 1596 (Fed. Cir. 1988); *In re Jones,* 958 F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941
 (Fed. Cir. 1992); see also *In re Kotzab,* 217 F.3d 1365, 1370, 55
 USPQ2d 1313, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (setting forth test for implicit teachings); *In re Eli Lilly & Co*., 902 F.2d 943, 14 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir.
 1990) (discussion of reliance on legal precedent); *In re Nilssen,* 851
 F.2d 1401, 1403, 7 USPQ2d 1500, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (references do not have to
 explicitly suggest combining teachings); *Ex parte Clapp,* 227 USPQ 972
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985) (examiner must present convincing line of reasoning
 supporting rejection); and *Ex parte Levengood,* 28 USPQ2d 1300 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1993) (reliance on logic and sound scientific reasoning). 

**II.** **THE EXPECTATION OF SOME ADVANTAGE IS THE STRONGEST RATIONALE FOR COMBINING
 REFERENCES**

The strongest rationale for combining references is a recognition,
 expressly or impliedly in the prior art or drawn from a convincing line of reasoning
 based on established scientific principles or legal precedent, that some advantage or
 expected beneficial result would have been produced by their combination. *In re
 Sernaker,* 702 F.2d 989, 994-95, 217 USPQ 1, 5-6 (Fed. Cir. 1983). See also *Dystar* *Textilfarben* *GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG* *v. C.H. Patrick,* 464 F.3d 1356, 1368, 80 USPQ2d 1641, 1651 (Fed.
 Cir. 2006) (“Indeed, we have repeatedly held that an implicit motivation to combine
 exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior art as a whole, but when
 the ‘improvement’ is technology-independent and the combination of references results in
 a product or process that is more desirable, for example because it is stronger,
 cheaper, cleaner, faster, lighter, smaller, more durable, or more efficient. Because the
 desire to enhance commercial opportunities by improving a product or process is
 universal—and even common-sensical—we have held that there exists in these situations a
 motivation to combine prior art references even absent any hint of suggestion in the
 references themselves.”). 

**III.** **LEGAL PRECEDENT CAN PROVIDE THE RATIONALE SUPPORTING OBVIOUSNESS ONLY IF THE
 FACTS IN THE CASE ARE SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE APPLICATION**

The examiner must apply the law consistently to each application after
 considering all the relevant facts. If the facts in a prior legal decision are
 sufficiently similar to those in an application under examination, the examiner may use
 the rationale used by the court. In this context, “sufficiently similar” does not
 necessarily require that the facts of the prior legal decision and those of the
 application under examination come from the same technological area. Rather, facts are
 sufficiently similar when they can be analogized to each other such that they present
 the same legal issue. For example, the combining prior art elements rationale was
 applied to a claimed vehicle pedal assembly in *KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex
 Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 417, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007), but that rationale
 applies broadly across a wide range of technologies; see, for example, the cases
 discussed in **[MPEP §
 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, subsection I.A. See also **[MPEP § 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**,
 subsection X.E. If the applicant has demonstrated the criticality of a specific
 limitation, it would not be appropriate to rely solely on the
 rationale used by the court to support an obviousness rejection. “The value of the
 exceedingly large body of precedent wherein our predecessor courts and this court have
 applied the law of obviousness to particular facts, is that there has been built a wide
 spectrum of illustrations and accompanying reasoning, that have been melded into a
 fairly consistent application of law to a great variety of facts.” *In re Eli
 Lilly & Co.,* 902 F.2d 943, 14 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 1990). 

**IV.** **RATIONALE DIFFERENT FROM APPLICANT’S IS PERMISSIBLE**

The reason or motivation to modify the reference may often suggest what
 the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different problem. It
 is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve the same
 advantage or result discovered by applicant. See, e.g., *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d 977, 987, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (motivation question arises in
 the context of the general problem confronting the inventor rather than the specific
 problem solved by the invention); *Cross Med. Prods., Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor
 Danek, Inc.,* 424 F.3d 1293, 1323, 76 USPQ2d 1662, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
 (“One of ordinary skill in the art need not see the identical problem addressed in a
 prior art reference to be motivated to apply its teachings.”); *In re
 Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972) (discussed below); *In re Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), *cert. denied,* 500 U.S. 904 (1991) (discussed below). 

In *In re Lintner,* the claimed invention was a
 laundry composition consisting essentially of a dispersant, cationic fabric softener,
 sugar, sequestering phosphate, and brightener in specified proportions. The claims were
 rejected over the combination of a primary reference which taught all the claim
 limitations except for the presence of sugar, and secondary references which taught the
 addition of sugar as a filler or weighting agent in compositions containing cationic
 fabric softeners. Appellant argued that in the claimed invention, the sugar is
 responsible for the compatibility of the cationic softener with the other detergent
 components. The court sustained the rejection, stating “The fact that appellant uses
 sugar for a different purpose does not alter the conclusion that its use in a prior art
 composition would be [*sic,* would have been] *prima
 facie* obvious from the purpose disclosed in the references.” 173 USPQ at
 562. 

In *In re Dillon,* applicant claimed a composition
 comprising a hydrocarbon fuel and a sufficient amount of a tetra-orthoester of a
 specified formula to reduce the particulate emissions from the combustion of the fuel.
 The claims were rejected as obvious over a reference which taught hydrocarbon fuel
 compositions containing tri-orthoesters for dewatering fuels, in combination with a
 reference teaching the equivalence of tri-orthoesters and tetra-orthoesters as water
 scavengers in hydraulic (nonhydrocarbon) fluids. The Board affirmed the rejection
 finding “there was a ‘reasonable expectation’ that the tri- and tetra-orthoester fuel
 compositions would have similar properties based on ‘close structural and chemical
 similarity’ between the tri- and tetra-orthoesters and the fact that both the prior art
 and Dillon use these compounds ‘as fuel additives’.” 919 F.2d at 692, 16 USPQ2d at 1900.
 The court held “it is not necessary in order to establish a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness . . . that there be a suggestion or expectation
 from *the prior art* that the claimed [invention] will have the same or
 a similar utility as *one newly discovered by applicant,*” and
 concluded that here a *prima facie* case was established because “[t]he
 art provided the motivation to make the claimed compositions in the expectation that
 they would have similar properties.” 919 F.2d at 693, 16 USPQ2d at 1901 (emphasis in
 original). 

See **[MPEP
 § 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**, subsection II, for case law pertaining to the presence
 of additional advantages or latent properties not recognized in the prior art. 

# 2144.01 Implicit Disclosure [R-10.2019]

“[I]n considering the disclosure of a reference, it is proper to take
 into account not only specific teachings of the reference but also the inferences which
 one skilled in the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom.” *In re
 Preda,* 401 F.2d 825, 826, 159 USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968) (A process for
 catalytically producing carbon disulfide by reacting sulfur vapor and methane in the
 presence of charcoal at a temperature of “about 750-830°C” was found to be met by a
 reference which expressly taught the same process at 700°C because the reference
 recognized the possibility of using temperatures greater than 750°C. The reference
 disclosed that catalytic processes for converting methane with sulfur vapors into carbon
 disulfide at temperatures greater than 750°C (albeit without charcoal) was known, and
 that 700°C was “much lower than had previously proved feasible.”); *In re
 Lamberti,* 545 F.2d 747, 750, 192 USPQ 278, 280 (CCPA 1976) (Reference
 disclosure of a compound where the R-S-R' portion has “at least one methylene group
 attached to the sulfur atom” implies that the other R group attached to the sulfur atom
 can be other than methylene and therefore suggests asymmetric dialkyl moieties.). 

# 2144.02 Reliance on Scientific Theory [R-08.2012]

The rationale to support a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** may
 rely on logic and sound scientific principle. *In re Soli,* 317 F.2d
 941, 137 USPQ 797 (CCPA 1963). However, when an examiner relies on a scientific theory,
 evidentiary support for the existence and meaning of that theory must be provided. *In re Grose,* 592 F.2d 1161, 201 USPQ 57 (CCPA 1979) (Court held
 that different crystal forms of zeolites would not have been structurally obvious one
 from the other because there was no chemical theory supporting such a conclusion. The
 known chemical relationship between structurally similar compounds (homologs, analogs,
 isomers) did not support a finding of *prima facie* obviousness of
 claimed zeolite over the prior art because a zeolite is not a compound but a mixture of
 compounds related to each other by a particular crystal structure.). 

# 2144.03 Reliance on Common Knowledge in the Art or “Well Known” Prior Art [R-01.2024]

In certain circumstances where appropriate, an examiner may take
 official notice of facts not in the record or rely on “common knowledge” in making a
 rejection, however such rejections should be judiciously applied. 

**PROCEDURE FOR RELYING ON COMMON KNOWLEDGE OR TAKING OFFICIAL NOTICE**

The standard of review applied to findings of fact is the
 “substantial evidence” standard under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5
 U.S.C. 500 *et seq.* See *In re Gartside,* 203 F.3d
 1305, 1315, 53 USPQ2d 1769, 1775 (Fed. Cir. 2000). See also **[MPEP § 1216.01](s1216.html#d0e130981)**. In
 light of recent Federal Circuit decisions as discussed below and the substantial
 evidence standard of review now applied to USPTO Board decisions, the following
 guidance is provided in order to assist the examiners in determining when it is
 appropriate to take official notice of facts without supporting documentary evidence
 or to rely on common knowledge in the art in making a rejection, and if such official
 notice is taken, what evidence is necessary to support the examiner’s conclusion of
 common knowledge in the art. 

***A.******Determining When It Is Appropriate To Take Official Notice Without
 Documentary Evidence To Support the Examiner’s Conclusion***

Official notice without documentary evidence to support an
 examiner’s conclusion is permissible only in some circumstances. It is always
 preferable, when reasonably possible, for the examiner to cite a prior art
 reference rather than to rely on official notice. When an application is under
 final rejection or action under **[37 CFR 1.113](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322575)**, official notice
 should be rarely used. 

Official notice unsupported by documentary
 evidence may be taken by the examiner where the facts asserted to be well-known,
 or to be common knowledge in the art, are “capable of such instant and
 unquestionable demonstration as to defy dispute.” *In re Ahlert,* 424 F.2d 1088, 1091, 165 USPQ 418, 420 (CCPA 1970) (citing *In re Knapp
 Monarch Co.,* 296 F.2d 230, 132 USPQ 6 (CCPA 1961)). In *Ahlert,* the court held that the Board properly took judicial
 notice that “it is old to adjust intensity of a flame in accordance with the heat
 requirement.” Note that in this case the noticed fact was beyond dispute, so the
 court affirmed even though no evidence had been presented as to any prior art
 disclosure providing “instant and unquestionable demonstration” of that fact. See
 also *In re Fox,* 471 F.2d 1405, 1407, 176 USPQ 340, 341 (CCPA
 1973) (the court took “judicial notice of the fact that tape recorders commonly
 erase tape automatically when new ‘audio information’ is recorded on a tape which
 already has a recording on it”). In appropriate circumstances, it might be
 reasonable to take official notice of the fact that it is desirable to make
 something faster, cheaper, better, or stronger without the specific support of
 documentary evidence. Furthermore, it might be reasonable for the examiner in a
 first Office action to take official notice of facts by asserting that certain
 limitations in a dependent claim are old and well known expedients in the art
 without the support of documentary evidence provided the facts so noticed are of
 notorious character and serve only to “fill in the gaps” which might exist in the
 evidentiary showing made by the examiner to support a particular ground of
 rejection. *In re Zurko,* 258 F.3d 1379, 1385, 59 USPQ2d 1693,
 1697 (Fed. Cir. 2001); *Ahlert,* 424 F.2d at 1092, 165 USPQ at
 421. 

It would not be appropriate for the
 examiner to take official notice of facts without citing a prior art reference
 where the facts asserted to be well known are not beyond dispute, or are not
 capable of instant and unquestionable demonstration as being well-known. See *Ahlert,* 424 F.2d at 1091, 165 USPQ at 420. Even if the
 examiner appropriately believes such fact may be of beyond dispute, it is not
 advisable to rely on official notice when an examiner can find a prior art
 disclosure to support the fact at issue. Assertions of technical facts in the
 areas of esoteric technology or specific knowledge of the prior art must always be
 supported by citation to some reference work recognized as standard in the
 pertinent art. *Ahlert,* 424 F.2d at 1091, 165 USPQ at 420-21.
 See also *In re Grose,* 592 F.2d 1161, 1167-68, 201 USPQ 57, 63
 (CCPA 1979) (“When the PTO seeks to rely upon a chemical theory, in establishing a
 prima facie case of obviousness, it must provide evidentiary support for the
 existence and meaning of that theory.”); *In re Eynde,* 480 F.2d
 1364, 1370, 178 USPQ 470, 474 (CCPA 1973) (“[W]e reject the notion that judicial
 or administrative notice may be taken of the state of the art. The facts
 constituting the state of the art are normally subject to the possibility of
 rational disagreement among reasonable men and are not amenable to the taking of
 such notice.”). 

It is never appropriate to rely solely on “common knowledge” in
 the art without evidentiary support in the record, as the principal evidence upon
 which a rejection was based. *Zurko,* 258 F.3d at 1385, 59 USPQ2d
 at 1697 (“[T]he Board cannot simply reach conclusions based on its own
 understanding or experience—or on its assessment of what would be basic knowledge
 or common sense. Rather, the Board must point to some concrete evidence in the
 record in support of these findings.”). While the court explained that, “as an
 administrative tribunal the Board clearly has expertise in the subject matter over
 which it exercises jurisdiction,” it made clear that such “expertise may provide
 sufficient support for conclusions [only] as to peripheral issues.” *Id.* at 1385-86, 59 USPQ2d at 1697. As the court held in *Zurko,* an assessment of basic knowledge and common sense
 that is not based on any evidence in the record lacks substantial evidence
 support. *Id.* at 1385, 59 USPQ2d at 1697. See also *Arendi v. Apple,* 832 F.3d 1355, 119 USPQ2d 1822 (Fed. Cir.
 2016) (finding that the Board had not provided a reasoned analysis, supported by
 the evidence of record, for why “common sense” taught the missing process step).
 See also *In re Van Os*, 844 F.3d 1359, 1361, 121 USPQ2d 1209,
 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (“Absent some articulated rationale, a finding that a
 combination of prior art would have been ‘common sense’ or ‘intuitive’ is no
 different than merely stating the combination ‘would have been obvious.’ ... Here,
 neither the Board nor the examiner provided any reasoning or analysis to support
 finding a motivation to add Gillespie's disclosure to Hawkins beyond stating it
 would have been an ‘intuitive way’ to initiate Hawkins’ editing mode.”). 

***B.******If Official Notice Is Taken of a Fact, Unsupported by Documentary
 Evidence, the Technical Line of Reasoning Underlying a Decision To Take Such
 Notice Must Be Clear and Unmistakable***

In certain older cases, official notice has been taken of a fact
 that is asserted to be “common knowledge” without specific reliance on documentary
 evidence where the fact noticed was readily verifiable, such as when other
 references of record supported the noticed fact, or where there was nothing of
 record to contradict it. See *In re Soli,* 317 F.2d 941, 945-46,
 137 USPQ 797, 800 (CCPA 1963) (accepting the examiner’s assertion that the use of
 “a control is standard procedure throughout the entire field of bacteriology”
 because it was readily verifiable and disclosed in references of record not cited
 by the Office); *In re Chevenard,* 139 F.2d 711, 713, 60 USPQ
 239, 241 (CCPA 1943) (accepting the examiner’s finding that a brief heating at a
 higher temperature was the equivalent of a longer heating at a lower temperature
 where there was nothing in the record to indicate the contrary and where the
 applicant never demanded that the examiner produce evidence to support his
 statement). If such notice is taken, the basis for such reasoning must be set
 forth explicitly. The examiner must provide specific factual findings predicated
 on sound technical and scientific reasoning to support the conclusion of common
 knowledge. See *Soli,* 317 F.2d at 946, 37 USPQ at 801; *Chevenard,* 139 F.2d at 713, 60 USPQ at 241. The applicant
 should be presented with the explicit basis on which the examiner regards the
 matter as subject to official notice so as to allow the applicant an opportunity
 to adequately traverse the rejection in the next reply after the Office action in
 which the "common knowledge" statement was made. 

***C.******If Applicant Traverses a Factual Assertion as Not Properly Officially
 Noticed or Not Properly Based Upon Common Knowledge, the Examiner Must
 Support the Finding With Adequate Evidence***

To adequately traverse a finding based on official notice, an
 applicant must specifically point out the supposed errors in the examiner’s
 action, which would include stating why the noticed fact is not considered to be
 common knowledge or well-known in the art. A mere request by the applicant that
 the examiner provide documentary evidence in support of an officially-noticed fact
 is not a proper traversal. See **[37 CFR 1.111(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449)**. See also *Chevenard,* 139 F.2d at 713, 60 USPQ at 241. A general
 allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without any reference to
 the examiner’s assertion of official notice would be inadequate. If applicant
 adequately traverses the examiner’s assertion of official notice, the examiner
 must provide documentary evidence in the next Office action if the rejection is to
 be maintained. If the examiner is relying on personal knowledge to support the
 finding of what is known in the art, the examiner must provide an affidavit or
 declaration setting forth specific factual statements and explanation to support
 the finding. See **[37 CFR 1.104(d)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322124)**. 

If applicant does not traverse the examiner’s assertion of
 official notice or applicant’s traverse is not adequate, the examiner should
 clearly indicate in the next Office action that the common knowledge or well-known
 in the art statement is taken to be admitted prior art because applicant either
 failed to traverse the examiner’s assertion of official notice or that the
 traverse was inadequate. See *Ahlert,* 424 F.2d at 1091, 165 USPQ
 at 420. If the traverse was inadequate, the examiner should include an explanation
 as to why it was inadequate. 

***D.******Determine Whether the Next Office Action Should Be Made
 Final***

If the examiner adds a reference in the next Office action after
 applicant’s rebuttal, and the newly added reference is added only as directly
 corresponding evidence to support the prior common knowledge finding, and it does
 not result in a new issue or constitute a new ground of rejection, the Office
 action may be made final. If no amendments are made to the claims, the examiner
 must not rely on any other teachings in the reference if the rejection is made
 final. If the newly cited reference is added for reasons other than to support the
 prior common knowledge statement or a new ground of rejection is introduced by the
 examiner that is not necessitated by applicant’s amendment of the claims, the
 rejection may not be made final. See **[MPEP § 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e68889)**. 

***E.******Summary***

Any rejection based on assertions that a fact is well-known or is
 common knowledge in the art without documentary evidence to support the examiner’s
 conclusion should be judiciously applied. Furthermore, as noted by the court in *Ahlert,* any facts so noticed should be of notorious
 character and serve only to “fill in the gaps” in an insubstantial manner which
 might exist in the evidentiary showing made by the examiner to support a
 particular ground for rejection. It is never appropriate to rely solely on common
 knowledge in the art without evidentiary support in the record as the principal
 evidence upon which a rejection was based. See *Zurko,* 258 F.3d
 at 1386, 59 USPQ2d at 1697; *Ahlert,* 424 F.2d at 1092, 165 USPQ
 421. Also, official notice should be rarely used when an application is under
 final rejection or action under **[37 CFR 1.113](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322575)**. 

# 2144.04 Legal Precedent as Source of Supporting Rationale [R-07.2022]

As discussed in **[MPEP § 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**, an examiner may utilize
 legal precedent as a source of supporting rationale when warranted and appropriately
 supported. In formulating any rejection invoking legal precedent, the examiner must take
 care to ensure that the rationale is explained and shown to apply to the facts at hand.
 Examples directed to various common practices which the court has held normally require
 only ordinary skill in the art and hence are considered routine expedients are discussed
 below. If the applicant has demonstrated the criticality of a specific limitation, it
 would not be appropriate to rely solely on case law as the rationale to support an
 obviousness rejection. 

**I.** **AESTHETIC DESIGN CHANGES**

*In re Seid,* 161 F.2d 229, 73 USPQ 431 (CCPA 1947) (Claim was
 directed to an advertising display device comprising a bottle and a hollow member in
 the shape of a human figure from the waist up which was adapted to fit over and cover
 the neck of the bottle, wherein the hollow member and the bottle together give the
 impression of a human body. Appellant argued that certain limitations in the upper
 part of the body, including the arrangement of the arms, were not taught by the prior
 art. The court found that matters relating to ornamentation only which have no
 mechanical function cannot be relied upon to patentably distinguish the claimed
 invention from the prior art.). But see *Ex parte Hilton,* 148 USPQ
 356 (Bd. App. 1965) (Claims were directed to fried potato chips with a specified
 moisture and fat content, whereas the prior art was directed to french fries having a
 higher moisture content. While recognizing that in some cases the particular shape of
 a product is of no patentable significance, the Board held in this case the shape
 (chips) is important because it results in a product which is distinct from the
 reference product (french fries).). 

**II.** **ELIMINATION OF A STEP OR AN ELEMENT AND ITS FUNCTION*****A.******Omission of an Element and Its Function Is Obvious if the Function of
 the Element Is Not Desired***

*Ex parte Wu,* 10 USPQ 2031 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989)
 (Claims at issue were directed to a method for inhibiting corrosion on metal
 surfaces using a composition consisting of epoxy resin,
 petroleum sulfonate, and hydrocarbon diluent. The claims were rejected over a
 primary reference which disclosed an anticorrosion composition of epoxy resin,
 hydrocarbon diluent, and polybasic acid salts wherein said salts were taught to be
 beneficial when employed in a freshwater environment, in view of secondary
 references which clearly suggested the addition of petroleum sulfonate to
 corrosion inhibiting compositions. The Board affirmed the rejection, holding that
 it would have been obvious to omit the polybasic acid salts of the primary
 reference where the function attributed to such salt is not desired or required,
 such as in compositions for providing corrosion resistance in environments which
 do not encounter fresh water.). See also *In re**Larson,* 340 F.2d 965, 144 USPQ 347 (CCPA 1965) (Omission of
 additional framework and axle which served to increase the cargo carrying capacity
 of prior art mobile fluid carrying unit would have been obvious if this feature
 was not desired.); and *In re Kuhle,* 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7
 (CCPA 1975) (deleting a prior art switch member and thereby eliminating its
 function was an obvious expedient). 

***B.******Omission of an Element with Retention of the Element's Function Is an
 Indicium of Nonobviousness***

Note that the omission of an element and retention of its function is an indicium of
 nonobviousness. *In re**Edge,* 359 F.2d 896, 149 USPQ 556 (CCPA 1966) (Claims at issue
 were directed to a printed sheet having a thin layer of erasable metal bonded
 directly to the sheet wherein said thin layer obscured the original print until
 removal by erasure. The prior art disclosed a similar printed sheet which further
 comprised an intermediate transparent and erasure-proof protecting layer which
 prevented erasure of the printing when the top layer was erased. The claims were
 found nonobvious over the prior art because although the transparent layer of the
 prior art was eliminated, the function of the transparent layer was retained since
 appellant’s metal layer could be erased without erasing the printed indicia.). 

**III.** **AUTOMATING A MANUAL ACTIVITY**

*In re**Venner,* 262 F.2d 91, 95, 120 USPQ 193, 194 (CCPA 1958) (Appellant
 argued that claims to a permanent mold casting apparatus for molding trunk pistons
 were allowable over the prior art because the claimed invention combined “old
 permanent-mold structures together with a timer and solenoid which automatically
 actuates the known pressure valve system to release the inner core after a
 predetermined time has elapsed.” The court held that broadly providing an automatic
 or mechanical means to replace a manual activity which accomplished the same result
 is not sufficient to distinguish over the prior art.). 

**IV.** **CHANGES IN SIZE, SHAPE, OR SEQUENCE OF ADDING INGREDIENTS** -
***A.******Changes in Size/Proportion***

*In re Rose,* 220 F.2d 459, 105 USPQ 237 (CCPA 1955) (Claims
 directed to a lumber package “of appreciable size and weight requiring handling by
 a lift truck” were held unpatentable over prior art lumber packages which could be
 lifted by hand because limitations relating to the size of the package were not
 sufficient to patentably distinguish over the prior art.); *In re
 Rinehart,* 531 F.2d 1048, 189 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1976) (“mere scaling up
 of a prior art process capable of being scaled up, if such were the case, would
 not establish patentability in a claim to an old process so scaled.” 531 F.2d at
 1053, 189 USPQ at 148.). 

In *Gardner**v.**TEC Syst., Inc.,* 725 F.2d 1338, 220 USPQ 777 (Fed. Cir. 1984), *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 830, 225 USPQ 232 (1984), the Federal
 Circuit held that, where the only difference between the prior art and the claims
 was a recitation of relative dimensions of the claimed device and a device having
 the claimed relative dimensions would not perform differently than the prior art
 device, the claimed device was not patentably distinct from the prior art
 device. 

***B.******Changes in Shape***

*In re**Dailey,* 357 F.2d 669, 149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1966) (The court held
 that the configuration of the claimed disposable plastic nursing container was a
 matter of choice which a person of ordinary skill in the art would have found
 obvious absent persuasive evidence that the particular configuration of the
 claimed container was significant.). 

***C.******Changes in Sequence of Adding Ingredients***

*Ex parte Rubin,* 128 USPQ 440 (Bd. App. 1959) (Prior art
 reference disclosing a process of making a laminated sheet wherein a base sheet is
 first coated with a metallic film and thereafter impregnated with a thermosetting
 material was held to render *prima facie* obvious claims directed
 to a process of making a laminated sheet by reversing the order of the prior art
 process steps.). See also *In re**Burhans,* 154 F.2d 690, 69 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1946) (selection of
 any order of performing process steps is *prima facie* obvious in
 the absence of new or unexpected results); *In re**Gibson,* 39 F.2d 975, 5 USPQ 230 (CCPA 1930) (Selection of any
 order of mixing ingredients is *prima facie* obvious.). 

**V.** **MAKING PORTABLE, INTEGRAL, SEPARABLE, ADJUSTABLE, OR CONTINUOUS**

-
***A.******Making Portable***

*In re**Lindberg,* 194 F.2d 732, 93 USPQ 23 (CCPA 1952) (Fact that a
 claimed device is portable or movable is not sufficient by itself to patentably
 distinguish over an otherwise old device unless there are new or unexpected
 results.). 

***B.******Making Integral***

*In re**Larson,* 340 F.2d 965, 968, 144 USPQ 347, 349 (CCPA 1965) (A
 claim to a fluid transporting vehicle was rejected as obvious over a prior art
 reference which differed from the prior art in claiming a brake drum integral with
 a clamping means, whereas the brake disc and clamp of the prior art comprise
 several parts rigidly secured together as a single unit. The court affirmed the
 rejection holding, among other reasons, “that the use of a one piece construction
 instead of the structure disclosed in [the prior art] would be merely a matter of
 obvious engineering choice.”); but see *Schenck**v.**Nortron Corp.,* 713 F.2d 782, 218 USPQ 698 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
 (Claims were directed to a vibratory testing machine (a hard-bearing wheel
 balancer) comprising a holding structure, a base structure, and a supporting means
 which form “a single integral and gaplessly continuous piece.” Nortron argued that
 the invention is just making integral what had been made in four bolted pieces.
 The court found this argument unpersuasive and held that the claims were
 patentable because the prior art perceived a need for mechanisms to dampen
 resonance, whereas the inventor eliminated the need for dampening via the
 one-piece gapless support structure, showing insight that was contrary to the
 understandings and expectations of the art.). 

***C.******Making Separable***

*In re**Dulberg,* 289 F.2d 522, 523, 129 USPQ 348, 349 (CCPA 1961) (The
 claimed structure, a lipstick holder with a removable cap, was fully met by the
 prior art except that in the prior art the cap is “press fitted” and therefore not
 manually removable. The court held that “if it were considered desirable for any
 reason to obtain access to the end of [the prior art’s] holder to which the cap is
 applied, it would be obvious to make the cap removable for that purpose.”). 

***D.******Making Adjustable***

*In re Stevens,* 212 F.2d 197, 101 USPQ 284 (CCPA 1954) (Claims
 were directed to a handle for a fishing rod wherein the handle has a
 longitudinally adjustable finger hook, and the hand grip of the handle connects
 with the body portion by means of a universal joint. The court held that
 adjustability, where needed, is not a patentable advance, and because there was an
 art-recognized need for adjustment in a fishing rod, the substitution of a
 universal joint for the single pivot of the prior art would have been
 obvious.). 

***E.******Making Continuous***

*In re**Dilnot,* 319 F.2d 188, 138 USPQ 248 (CCPA 1963) (Claim directed
 to a method of producing a cementitious structure wherein a stable air foam is
 introduced into a slurry of cementitious material differed from the prior art only
 in requiring the addition of the foam to be continuous. The court held the claimed
 continuous operation would have been obvious in light of the batch process of the
 prior art.). 

**VI.** **REVERSAL, DUPLICATION, OR REARRANGEMENT OF PARTS** -
***A.******Reversal of Parts***

*In re**Gazda,* 219 F.2d 449, 104 USPQ 400 (CCPA 1955) (Prior art
 disclosed a clock fixed to the stationary steering wheel column of an automobile
 while the gear for winding the clock moves with steering wheel; mere reversal of
 such movement, so the clock moves with wheel, was held to be an obvious
 modification.). 

***B.******Duplication of Parts***

*In re**Harza,* 274 F.2d 669, 124 USPQ 378 (CCPA 1960) (Claims at issue
 were directed to a water-tight masonry structure wherein a water seal of flexible
 material fills the joints which form between adjacent pours of concrete. The
 claimed water seal has a “web” which lies in the joint, and a plurality of “ribs”
 projecting outwardly from each side of the web into one of the adjacent concrete
 slabs. The prior art disclosed a flexible water stop for preventing passage of
 water between masses of concrete in the shape of a plus sign (+). Although the
 reference did not disclose a plurality of ribs, the court held that mere
 duplication of parts has no patentable significance unless a new and unexpected
 result is produced.). 

***C.******Rearrangement of Parts***

*In re**Japikse,* 181 F.2d 1019, 86 USPQ 70 (CCPA 1950) (Claims to a
 hydraulic power press which read on the prior art except with regard to the
 position of the starting switch were held unpatentable because shifting the
 position of the starting switch would not have modified the operation of the
 device.); *In re Kuhle,* 526 F.2d 553, 188 USPQ 7 (CCPA 1975)
 (the particular placement of a contact in a conductivity measuring device was held
 to be an obvious matter of design choice). 

**VII.** **PURIFYING AN OLD PRODUCT**

Pure materials are novel *vis-à-vis* less pure or
 impure materials because there is a difference between pure and impure materials.
 Therefore, the issue is whether claims to a pure material are nonobvious over the
 prior art. *In re**Bergstrom,* 427 F.2d 1394, 166 USPQ 256 (CCPA 1970). Purer forms of
 known products may be patentable, but the mere purity of a product, by itself, does
 not render the product nonobvious. 

Factors to be considered in determining whether a purified form of
 an old product is obvious over the prior art include whether the claimed chemical
 compound or composition has the same utility as closely related materials in the
 prior art, and whether the prior art suggests the particular form or structure of the
 claimed material or suitable methods of obtaining that form or structure. *In
 re**Cofer,* 354 F.2d 664, 148 USPQ 268 (CCPA 1966) (Claims to the
 free-flowing crystalline form of a compound were held nonobvious over references
 disclosing the viscous liquid form of the same compound because the prior art of
 record did not suggest the claimed compound in crystalline form or how to obtain such
 crystals.). However, in the case of product-by-process claims, if a first prior art
 process is improved to enhance the purity of the product produced by the process, and
 if the purified product has no structural or functional difference from the products
 produced by other prior art processes, then the improvement in the first process that
 improves the purity of the product does not give rise to patentability. See *Purdue Pharma v. Epic Pharma,* 811 F.3d 1345, 117 USPQ2d 1733
 (Fed. Cir. 2016). See also **[MPEP § 2113](s2113.html#d0e201450)**. 

See also *Ex parte**Stern,* 13 USPQ2d 1379 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987) (Claims to
 interleukin-2 (a protein with a molecular weight of over 12,000) purified to
 homogeneity were held unpatentable over references which recognized the desirability
 of purifying interleukin-2 to homogeneity in a view of a reference which taught a
 method of purifying proteins having molecular weights in excess of 12,000 to
 homogeneity wherein the prior art method was similar to the method disclosed by
 appellant for purifying interleukin-2). 

# 2144.05 Obviousness of Similar and Overlapping Ranges, Amounts, and Proportions [R-01.2024]

See **[MPEP
 § 2131.03](s2131.html#d0e203269)** for case law pertaining to rejections based on the
 anticipation of ranges under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. 

**I.** **OVERLAPPING, APPROACHING, AND SIMILAR RANGES, AMOUNTS, AND PROPORTIONS**

In the case where the claimed ranges “overlap or lie inside ranges
 disclosed by the prior art” a *prima facie* case of obviousness
 exists. *In re**Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976); *In
 re**Woodruff,* 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d 1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (The
 prior art taught carbon monoxide concentrations of “about 1-5%” while the claim was
 limited to “more than 5%.” The court held that “about 1-5%” allowed for
 concentrations slightly above 5% thus the ranges overlapped.); *In re
 Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 1469-71, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir.
 1997) (Claim reciting thickness of a protective layer as falling within a range of
 “50 to 100 Angstroms” considered *prima facie* obvious in view of
 prior art reference teaching that “for suitable protection, the thickness of the
 protective layer should be not less than about 10 nm [i.e., 100 Angstroms].” The
 court stated that “by stating that ‘suitable protection’ is provided if the
 protective layer is ‘about’ 100 Angstroms thick, [the prior art reference] directly
 teaches the use of a thickness within [applicant’s] claimed range.”). See also *In re Bergen,* 120 F.2d 329, 332, 49 USPQ 749, 751-52 (CCPA
 1941) (The court found that the overlapping endpoint of the prior art and claimed
 range was sufficient to support an obviousness rejection, particularly when there was
 no showing of criticality of the claimed range). 

Similarly, a *prima facie* case of
 obviousness exists where the claimed ranges or amounts do not overlap with the prior
 art but are merely close. *Titanium Metals Corp. of America**v.**Banner,* 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (Court held as proper a rejection of a claim directed to an alloy of “having 0.8%
 nickel, 0.3% molybdenum, up to 0.1% iron, balance titanium” as obvious over a
 reference disclosing alloys of 0.75% nickel, 0.25% molybdenum, balance titanium and
 0.94% nickel, 0.31% molybdenum, balance titanium. “The proportions are so close that
 prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same
 properties.”). See also *Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc. v. Hilton Davis Chemical
 Co.,* 520 U.S. 17, 41 USPQ2d 1865 (1997) (under the doctrine of

 a temperature between 40°C and 80°C and an acid concentration between 25% and 70% was

 than 120°); *In re Becket,* 88 F.2d 684 (CCPA 1937) (“Where the
 component elements of alloys are the same, and where they approach so closely the
 same range of quantities as is here the case, it seems that there ought to be some
 noticeable difference in the qualities of the respective alloys.”); *In re
 Dreyfus,* 73 F.2d 931, 934, 24 USPQ 52, 55 (CCPA 1934)(the prior art,
 which taught about 0.7:1 of alkali to water, renders unpatentable a claim that
 increased the proportion to at least 1:1 because there was no showing that the
 claimed proportions were critical); *In re Lilienfeld,* 67 F.2d 920,
 924, 20 USPQ 53, 57 (CCPA 1933)(the prior art teaching an alkali cellulose containing
 minimal amounts of water, found by the Examiner to be in the 5-8% range, the claims
 sought to be patented were to an alkali cellulose with varying higher ranges of water
 (e.g., “not substantially less than 13%,” “not substantially below 17%,” and “between
 about 13[%] and 20%”); *K-Swiss Inc. v. Glide N Lock GmbH,* 567 Fed.
 App'x 906 (Fed. Cir. 2014)(reversing the Board's decision, in an appeal of an *inter partes* reexamination proceeding, that certain claims were

 Cir. 2018)(the court found a *prima facie* case of obviousness had
 been made in a predictable art wherein the claimed range of “less than 6 pounds per
 cubic feet” and the prior art range of “between 6 lbs./ft3 and 25 lbs./ft3” were so mathematically close that the
 difference between the claimed ranges was virtually negligible absent any showing of
 unexpected results or criticality.). 

"[A] prior art reference that discloses a range encompassing a
 somewhat narrower claimed range is sufficient to establish a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness." *In re Peterson,* 315 F.3d
 1325, 1330, 65 USPQ2d 1379, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003). See also *In re
 Harris,* 409 F.3d 1339, 74 USPQ2d 1951 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (claimed alloy
 held obvious over prior art alloy that taught ranges of weight percentages
 overlapping, and in most instances completely encompassing, claimed ranges;
 furthermore, narrower ranges taught by reference overlapped all but one range in
 claimed invention). However, if the reference’s disclosed range is so broad as to
 encompass a very large number of possible distinct compositions, this might present a
 situation analogous to the obviousness of a species when the prior art broadly
 discloses a genus. *Id.* See also *In re Baird,* 16
 F.3d 380, 383, 29 USPQ2d 1550, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (“[a] disclosure of millions of
 compounds does not render obvious a claim to three compounds, particularly when that
 disclosure indicates a preference leading away from the claimed compounds.”); **[MPEP §
 2144.08](s2144.html#d0e211596)**; and subsection III.D below for an additional
 discussion on consideration of prior art disclosures of a broad range. 

A range can be disclosed in multiple prior art references instead of
 in a single prior art reference depending on the specific facts of the case. *Iron Grip Barbell Co., Inc. v. USA Sports, Inc.,* 392 F.3d 1317,
 1322, 73 USPQ2d 1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The patent claim at issue was directed
 to a weight plate having 3 elongated openings that served as handles for transporting
 the weight plate. Multiple prior art patents each disclosed weight plates having 1, 2
 or 4 elongated openings. 392 F.3d at 1319, 73 USPQ2d at 1226. The court stated that
 the claimed weight plate having 3 elongated openings fell within the “range” of the
 prior art and was thus presumed obvious. 392 F.3d at 1322, 73 USPQ2d at 1228. The
 court further stated that the “range” disclosed in multiple prior art patents is “a
 distinction without a difference” from previous range cases which involved a range
 disclosed in a single patent since the “prior art suggested that a larger number of
 elongated grips in the weight plates was beneficial… thus plainly suggesting that one
 skilled in the art look to the range appearing in the prior art.” *Id.*

**II.** **ROUTINE OPTIMIZATION**

-
***A.******Optimization Within Prior Art Conditions or Through Routine
 Experimentation***

Generally, differences in concentration or temperature will not
 support the patentability of subject matter encompassed by the prior art unless
 there is evidence indicating such concentration or temperature is critical.
 “[W]here the general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the prior art, it is
 not inventive to discover the optimum or workable ranges by routine
 experimentation.” *In re**Aller,* 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA 1955)
 (Claimed process which was performed at a temperature between 40°C and 80°C and an
 acid concentration between 25% and 70% was held to be *prima
 facie* obvious over a reference process which differed from the claims
 only in that the reference process was performed at a temperature of 100°C and an
 acid concentration of 10%.); see also *Peterson,* 315 F.3d at
 1330, 65 USPQ2d at 1382 (“The normal desire of scientists or artisans to improve
 upon what is already generally known provides the motivation to determine where in
 a disclosed set of percentage ranges is the optimum combination of percentages.”); *In re**Hoeschele,* 406 F.2d 1403, 160 USPQ 809 (CCPA 1969) (Claimed
 elastomeric polyurethanes which fell within the broad scope of the references were
 held to be unpatentable thereover because, among other reasons, there was no
 evidence of the criticality of the claimed ranges of molecular weight or molar
 proportions.). For more recent cases applying this principle, see *Merck
 & Co. Inc.**v.**Biocraft Lab. Inc.,* 874 F.2d 804, 809, 10 USPQ2d 1843, 1848
 (Fed. Cir. 1989), *cert. denied,* 493 U.S. 975 (1989)(Claimed
 ratios were obvious as being reached by routine procedures and producing
 predictable results);  *In re**Kulling,* 897 F.2d 1147, 1149, 14 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir.
 1990)(Claimed amount of wash solution was found to be unpatentable as a matter of
 routine optimization in the pertinent art, further supported by the prior art
 disclosure of the need to avoid undue amounts of wash solution); and *In
 re Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 1470, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir.
 1997)(Claims were unpatentable because appellants failed to submit evidence of
 criticality to demonstrate that that the wear resistance of the protective layer
 in the claimed thickness range of 50-100 Angstroms was “unexpectedly good”); *Smith v. Nichols,* 88 U.S. 112, 118-19 (1874) (a change in
 form, proportions, or degree “will not sustain a patent”); *In re
 Williams,* 36 F.2d 436, 438, 4 USPQ 237 (CCPA 1929) (“It is a settled
 principle of law that a mere carrying forward of an original patented conception
 involving only change of form, proportions, or degree, or the substitution of
 equivalents doing the same thing as the original invention, by substantially the
 same means, is not such an invention as will sustain a patent, even though the
 changes of the kind may produce better results than prior inventions.”). See also *KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 416, 82 USPQ2d
 1385, 1395 (2007) (identifying “the need for caution in granting a patent based on
 the combination of elements found in the prior art.”). 

***B.******There Must Be an Articulated Rationale Supporting the
 Rejection***

In order to properly support a rejection on the
 basis that an invention is the result of “routine optimization”, the examiner must
 make findings of relevant facts, and present the underpinning reasoning in
 sufficient detail. The articulated rationale must include an explanation of why it
 would have been routine optimization to arrive at the claimed invention and why a
 person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation of
 success to formulate the claimed range. See *In re Stepan*, 868
 F.3d 1342, 1346, 123 USPQ2d 1838, 1841 (Fed. Cir. 2017). See also *In re
 Van Os*, 844 F.3d 1359,1361,121 USPQ2d 1209, 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2017)
 (“Absent some articulated rationale, a finding that a combination of prior art
 would have been ‘common sense’ or ‘intuitive’ is no different than merely stating
 the combination ‘would have been obvious.’”); *Arendi S.A.R.L. v. Apple
 Inc.*, 832 F.3d 1355, 1362, 119 USPQ2d 1822 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (“[R]eferences to ‘common sense’ … cannot be used as a wholesale substitute for
 reasoned analysis and evidentiary support … .”). 

The Supreme Court has clarified that an "obvious to try" line of
 reasoning may properly support an obviousness rejection. In *In re
 Antonie,* 559 F.2d 618, 195 USPQ 6 (CCPA 1977), the CCPA held that a
 particular parameter must first be recognized as a result-effective variable,
 i.e., a variable which achieves a recognized result, before the determination of
 the optimum or workable ranges of said variable might be characterized as routine
 experimentation, because “obvious to try” is not a valid rationale for an
 obviousness finding. However, in *KSR International Co. v. Teleflex
 Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007), the Supreme Court held
 that “obvious to try” was a valid rationale for an obviousness finding, for
 example, when there is a “design need” or “market demand” and there are a “finite
 number” of solutions. 550 U.S. at 421, 82 USPQ2d at 1397 (“The same constricted
 analysis led the Court of Appeals to conclude, in error, that a patent claim
 cannot be proved obvious merely by showing that the combination of elements was
 ‘[o]bvious to try.’ ... When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a
 problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a
 person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or
 her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the
 product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that instance
 the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious
 under **[§103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.”). Thus, after *KSR,* the presence
 of a known result-effective variable would be one, but not the only, motivation
 for a person of ordinary skill in the art to experiment to reach another workable
 product or process. 

**III.** **REBUTTAL OF *PRIMA FACIE* CASE OF OBVIOUSNESS**

-
***A.******Showing That the Range Is Critical***

Applicants can rebut a *prima facie* case of
 obviousness by showing the criticality of the range. “The law is replete with
 cases in which the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is
 some range or other variable within the claims. . . . In such a situation, the
 applicant must show that the particular range is critical, generally by showing
 that the claimed range achieves unexpected results relative to the prior art
 range.” *In re**Woodruff,* 919 F.2d 1575, 16 USPQ2d 1934 (Fed. Cir. 1990). See
 also *Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde,* 242 U.S. 261, 271
 (1916) (a patent based on a change in the proportions of a prior product or
 process (changing from 4-10% oil to 1% oil) must be confined to the proportions
 that were shown to be critical (1%)); *In re Scherl,* 156 F.2d
 72, 74-75, 70 USPQ 204, 205 (CCPA 1946) (“Where the issue of criticality is
 involved, the applicant has the burden of establishing his position by a proper
 showing of the facts upon which he relies.”); *In re Becket,* 88
 F.2d 684 (CCPA 1937) (“Where the component elements of alloys are the same, and
 where they approach so closely the same range of quantities as is here the case,
 it seems that there ought to be some noticeable difference in the qualities of the
 respective alloys.”); *In re Lilienfeld,* 67 F.2d 920, 924 (CCPA
 1933) (“It is well established that, while a change in the proportions of a
 combination shown to be old, such as is here involved, may be inventive, such
 changes must be critical as compared with the proportions used in the prior
 processes, producing a difference in kind rather than degree.”); *In re
 Wells,* 56 F.2d 674, 675, 12 USPQ 430 (CCPA 1932) (“Changes in
 proportions of agents used in combinations . . . in order to be patentable, must
 be critical as compared with the proportions of the prior processes.”); *E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company v. Synvina C.V.,* 904
 F.3d 996, 1006, 128 USPQ2d 1193, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2018.)(“[A] modification of a
 process parameter may be patentable if it ‘produce[s] a new and unexpected result
 which is different in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior
 art.” (citing *Aller,* 220 F.2d 454, 456, 105 USPQ 233, 235 (CCPA
 1955); *UCB, Inc. v. Actavis Labs, UT, Inc.,* 65 F.4th 679, 693,
 2023 USPQ2d 448 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (“A difference of degree is not as persuasive as
 a difference in kind – i.e., if the range produces ‘a new property dissimilar to
 the known property,’ rather than producing a predictable result but to an
 unexpected extent.”). 

See **[MPEP § 716.02](s716.html#d0e92844)** - **[§ 716.02(g)](s716.html#d0e93296)** for a discussion of criticality and
 unexpected results. 

***B.******Showing That the Prior Art Teaches Away***

A *prima facie* case of obviousness may also be
 rebutted by showing that the art, in any material respect, teaches away from the
 claimed invention. *U.S. v. Adams,* 383 U.S. 39, 51-2 (1966). See
 also *Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,* 567
 F.3d 1314, 1326, 90 USPQ2d 1865, 1873 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“An inference of
 nonobviousness is especially strong where the prior art’s teachings undermine the
 very reason being proffered as to why a person of ordinary skill would have
 combined the known elements.”) and *Allergan, Inc. v. Sandoz
 Inc.,* 796 F.3d 1293, 1305, 115 USPQ2d 2012, 2019 (Fed. Cir. 2015)
 (The prior art taught away from use of 200 ppm benzalkonium chloride (“BAK”), as
 claimed, teaching “that BAK should be minimized in ophthalmic formulations to
 avoid safety problems”.). 

Teaching away was not established in *In
 re Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 1471, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir.
 1997) (Applicant argued that the prior art taught away from use of a protective
 layer for a reflective article having a thickness within the claimed range of “50
 to 100 Angstroms.” Specifically, a patent to Zehender, which was relied upon to
 reject applicant’s claim, included a statement that the thickness of the
 protective layer “should be not less than about [100 Angstroms].” The court held
 that the patent did not teach away from the claimed invention. “Zehender suggests
 that there are benefits to be derived from keeping the protective layer as thin as
 possible, consistent with achieving adequate protection. A thinner coating reduces
 light absorption and minimizes manufacturing time and expense. Thus, while
 Zehender expresses a preference for a thicker protective layer of 200-300
 Angstroms, at the same time it provides the motivation for one of ordinary skill
 in the art to focus on thickness levels at the bottom of Zehender’s ‘suitable’
 range- about 100 Angstroms- and to explore thickness levels below that range. The
 statement in Zehender that ‘[i]n general, the thickness of the protective layer
 should be not less than about [100 Angstroms]’ falls far short of the kind of
 teaching that would discourage one of skill in the art from fabricating a
 protective layer of 100 Angstroms or less. [W]e are therefore ‘not convinced that
 there was a sufficient teaching away in the art to overcome [the] strong case of
 obviousness’ made out by Zehender.”). See **[MPEP § 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**, subsection X.D., for
 a discussion of “teaching away” references. 

Applicant can rebut a presumption of obviousness based on a
 claimed invention that falls within a prior art range by showing “(1) [t]hat the
 prior art taught away from the claimed invention...or (2) that there are new and
 unexpected results relative to the prior art.” *Iron Grip Barbell Co.,
 Inc. v. USA Sports, Inc.,* 392 F.3d 1317, 1322, 73 USPQ2d 1225, 1228
 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court found that patentee offered neither evidence of
 teaching away of the prior art nor new and unexpected results of the claimed
 invention drawn to a weight plate having three elongated handle openings. 392 F.3d
 at 1323, 73 USPQ2d at 1229. The court then turned to the patentee’s secondary
 considerations evidence of nonobviousness, such as commercial success,
 satisfaction of a long-felt need, and copying by others and found that Iron Grip
 had failed to establish: (A) a nexus between the licensing of its patent to three
 competitors and the “merits of the invention”; (B) that a competitor copied the
 claimed three-hole grip plate because “[n]ot every competing product that falls
 within the scope of a patent is evidence of copying” and “[o]therwise every
 infringement suit would automatically confirm the nonobviousness of the patent”;
 and (C) a long-felt but unmet need for the claimed three-hole grip plate prior to
 its patent because “[a]bsent a showing of a long-felt need or the failure of
 others, the mere passage of time without the claimed invention is not evidence of
 nonobviousness.” 392 F.3d at 1324-25, 73 USPQ2d at 1229-30. See also *In
 re Brandt,* 886 F.3d 1171, 1178, 126 USPQ2d 1079, 1083-1084 (Fed. Cir.
 2018) (The court determined the prior art did not teach away from the claimed
 invention because it only suggested that a denser coverboard could serve to
 protect a less dense insulation board and did not require a coverboard denser than
 6 lbs./ft3). 

**C.*****Showing That the Claimed
 Parameter Was Not Recognized as
 “Result-Effective”***

Applicants may rebut a *prima facie* case of obviousness based on optimization of a variable disclosed in a range in the
 prior art by showing that the claimed variable was not recognized in the prior art to
 be a result-effective variable. *E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Company v.
 Synvina C.V.,* 904 F.3d 996, 1008, 128 USPQ2d 1193, 1202 (Fed. Cir.
 2018). (“The idea behind the ‘result-effective variable’ analysis is straightforward.
 Our predecessor court reasoned that a person of ordinary skill would not always be
 motivated to optimize a parameter ‘if there is no evidence in the record that the
 prior art recognized that [that] particular parameter affected the result.’ *Antonie,* 559 F.2d at 620.) For example, in *Antonie* the claimed device was characterized by a certain
 ratio, and the prior art did not disclose that ratio and was silent regarding one of
 the variables in the ratio. *Id.* at 619. Our predecessor court thus
 reversed the Board’s conclusion of obviousness. *Id.* at 620. *Antonie* described the situation where a ‘parameter optimized
 was not recognized to be a result-effective variable’ as an ‘exception' to the
 general principle in *Aller* that 'the discovery of an optimum value
 of a variable in a known process is normally obvious.’ *Id.* at 620.
 Our subsequent cases have confirmed that this exception is a narrow one. … In
 summarizing the relevant precedent from our predecessor court, we observed in *Applied Materials* that ‘[i]n cases in which the disclosure in
 the prior art was insufficient to find a variable result-effective, there was
 essentially no disclosure of the relationship between the variable and the result in
 the prior art.' 692 F.3d at 1297. Likewise, if the prior art does recognize that the
 variable affects the relevant property or result, then the variable is
 result-effective. *Id.* (‘A recognition in the prior art that a
 property is affected by the variable is sufficient to find the variable
 result-effective.’)”). Applicants must articulate why the variable at issue would not
 have been recognized in the prior art as result-effective. However, it should be
 noted that after *KSR,* the presence of a known result-effective
 variable would be one, but not the only, motivation for a person of ordinary skill in
 the art to experiment to reach another workable product or process. *KSR
 International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007).
 See subsection II.B above for additional information about consideration of
 result-effective variables within an obviousness analysis. 

**D.*****Showing That a Claimed
 Parameter is Disclosed in a Very Broad Range in Prior Art***

One factor that may weigh against maintaining an
 obviousness rejection based on optimization of a variable disclosed in a range in the
 prior art is where an applicant establishes that the prior art disclosure of the
 variable is within a range that is so broad in light of the dissimilar
 characteristics of the members of the range as to not invite optimization by one of
 skill in the art. *Genetics Inst., LLC v. Novartis Vaccines &
 Diagnostics, Inc.,* 655 F.3d 1291, 1306, 99 USPQ2d 1713, 1725 (Fed. Cir.
 2011) (holding that ordinary motivation to optimize did not apply where disclosure
 was 68,000 protein variants including 2,332 amino acids where one of skill in the art
 would appreciate that the claimed truncated proteins vary enormously in structure).
 See **[MPEP §§

# 2144.06 Art Recognized Equivalence for the Same Purpose [R-01.2024]

**I.** **COMBINING EQUIVALENTS KNOWN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE**

“It is *prima facie* obvious to combine two
 compositions each of which is taught by the prior art to be useful for the same
 purpose, in order to form a third composition to be used for the very same
 purpose.... [T]he idea of combining them flows logically from their having been
 individually taught in the prior art.” *In re**Kerkhoven,* 626 F.2d 846, 850, 205 USPQ 1069, 1072 (CCPA 1980)
 (citations omitted) (Claims to a process of preparing a spray-dried detergent by
 mixing together two conventional spray-dried detergents were held to be *prima facie* obvious.). See also *In re**Crockett,* 279 F.2d 274, 126 USPQ 186 (CCPA 1960) (Claims directed
 to a method and material for treating cast iron using a mixture comprising calcium
 carbide and magnesium oxide were held unpatentable over prior art disclosures that
 the aforementioned components individually promote the formation of a nodular
 structure in cast iron.); *Ex parte Quadranti,* 25 USPQ2d 1071 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (mixture of two known herbicides held *prima
 facie* obvious); and *In re Couvaras,* 70 F.4th 1374,
 1378-79, 2023 USPQ2d 697 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (That the two claimed types of active
 agents, GABA-a agonists and ARBs, were known to be useful for the same
 purpose—alleviating hypertension—alone can serve as a motivation to combine). 

**II.** **SUBSTITUTING EQUIVALENTS KNOWN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE**

In order to rely on equivalence as a rationale supporting an
 obviousness rejection, the equivalency must be recognized in the prior art, and
 cannot be based on applicant’s disclosure or the mere fact that the components at
 issue are functional or mechanical equivalents. *In re**Ruff,* 256 F.2d 590, 118 USPQ 340 (CCPA 1958) (The mere fact that
 components are claimed as members of a Markush group cannot be relied upon to
 establish the equivalency of these components. However, an applicant’s expressed
 recognition of an art-recognized or obvious equivalent may be used to refute an
 argument that such equivalency does not exist.); *Smith**v.**Hayashi,* 209 USPQ 754 (Bd. of Pat. Inter. 1980) (The mere fact
 that phthalocyanine and selenium function as equivalent photoconductors in the
 claimed environment was not sufficient to establish that one would have been obvious
 over the other. However, there was evidence that both phthalocyanine and selenium
 were known photoconductors in the art of electrophotography. “This, in our view,
 presents strong evidence of obviousness in substituting one for the other in an
 electrophotographic environment as a photoconductor.” 209 USPQ at 759.). 

An express suggestion to substitute one equivalent component or
 process for another is not necessary to render such substitution obvious. *In
 re**Fout,* 675 F.2d 297, 213 USPQ 532 (CCPA 1982). 

# 2144.07 Art Recognized Suitability for an Intended Purpose [R-01.2024]

The selection of a known material based on its suitability for its
 intended use supported a *prima facie* obviousness determination in *Sinclair & Carroll Co. v.**Interchemical Corp.,* 325 U.S. 327, 65 USPQ 297 (1945) (Claims to a
 printing ink comprising a solvent having the vapor pressure characteristics of butyl
 carbitol so that the ink would not dry at room temperature but would dry quickly upon
 heating were held invalid over a reference teaching a printing ink made with a different
 solvent that was nonvolatile at room temperature but highly volatile when heated in view
 of an article which taught the desired boiling point and vapor pressure characteristics
 of a solvent for printing inks and a catalog teaching the boiling point and vapor
 pressure characteristics of butyl carbitol.)

**I.** **EXAMINATION OF CLAIMS DIRECTED TO SPECIES BASED UPON A SINGLE PRIOR ART
 REFERENCE**

When a single prior art reference which discloses a genus
 encompassing the claimed species or subgenus but does not expressly disclose the
 particular claimed species or subgenus, Office personnel should attempt to find
 additional prior art to show that the differences between the prior art primary
 reference and the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious. Where such
 additional prior art is not found, Office personnel should consider the factors
 discussed below to determine whether a single reference **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection would be appropriate. 

**II.** **DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMED SPECIES OR SUBGENUS WOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO
 ONE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE PERTINENT ART AT THE RELEVANT TIME**

The patentability of a claim to a specific compound, species, or
 subgenus embraced by a prior art genus should be analyzed no differently than any
 other claim for purposes of **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. “The section 103
 requirement of unobviousness is no different in chemical cases than with respect to
 other categories of patentable inventions.” *In re Papesch,* 315
 F.2d 381, 385, 137 USPQ 43, 47 (CCPA 1963). A determination of patentability under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made upon the facts of the particular case in
 view of the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g., *In re
 Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 692-93, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1901 (Fed. Cir. 1990) *(en banc)*. Use of *per se* rules by Office
 personnel is improper for determining whether claimed subject matter would have been
 obvious under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. See, e.g., *In re Brouwer,* 77
 F.3d 422, 425, 37 USPQ2d 1663, 1666 (Fed. Cir. 1996); *In re
 Ochiai,* 71 F.3d 1565, 1572, 37 USPQ2d 1127, 1133 (Fed. Cir. 1995); *In re Baird,* 16 F.3d 380, 382, 29 USPQ2d 1550, 1552 (Fed. Cir.
 1994). The fact that a claimed species or subgenus is encompassed by a prior art
 genus is not sufficient by itself to establish a *prima facie* case
 of obviousness. *In re Baird,* 16 F.3d 380, 382, 29 USPQ2d 1550,
 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (“The fact that a claimed compound may be encompassed by a
 disclosed generic formula does not by itself render that compound obvious.”); *In re Jones,* 958 F.2d 347, 350, 21 USPQ2d 1941, 1943 (Fed. Cir.
 1992) (Federal Circuit has “decline[d] to extract from *Merck* [*& Co. v. Biocraft Laboratories Inc.,* 874 F.2d 804, 10
 USPQ2d 1843 (Fed. Cir. 1989)] the rule that... regardless of how broad, a disclosure
 of a chemical genus renders obvious any species that happens to fall within it.”). 

***A.******Establishing a Prima Facie Case of Obviousness***

Office personnel must consider the factors set out by the Supreme
 Court in *Graham v. John Deere,* 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966)
 in order to establish a *prima facie* case of obviousness. See,
 e.g., *In re Bell,* 991 F.2d 781, 783, 26 USPQ2d 1529, 1531 (Fed.
 Cir. 1993) (“The PTO bears the burden of establishing a case of *prima
 facie* obviousness.”);  *In re Rijckaert,* 9 F.3d
 1531, 1532, 28 USPQ2d 1955, 1956 (Fed. Cir. 1993); *In re
 Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992). *Graham* at 17-18, 148 USPQ at 467 requires that to make out a
 case of obviousness, one must: 

- (A) determine the scope and contents of the prior art;
- (B) ascertain the differences between the prior art and the
 claims in issue;
- (C) determine the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art;
 and
- (D) evaluate any evidence of secondary considerations.


If a *prima facie* case is established, the
 burden shifts to applicant to come forward with rebuttal evidence or argument to
 overcome the *prima facie* case. See, e.g., *Bell,* 991 F.2d at 783-84, 26 USPQ2d at 1531; *Rijckaert,* 9 F.3d at 1532, 28 USPQ2d at 1956; *Oetiker,* 977 F.2d at 1445, 24 USPQ2d at 1444. Office
 personnel should evaluate, when appropriate, the totality of the facts and all of
 the evidence to determine whether they still support a conclusion that the claimed
 invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
 relevant time. See *Graham,* at 17-18, 148 USPQ at 467. See,
 e.g., **[MPEP §§
 714.12](s714.html#d0e87869)**, **[714.13](s714.html#d0e88092)**, and **[715.09](s715.html#d0e91958)** for
 guidance when rebuttal evidence or argument may not be considered. 

**1.** **Determine the Scope and Content of the Prior Art**

After construing the claims, Office personnel should determine
 the scope and content of the relevant prior art. Each reference to be applied
 as the basis for an obviousness rejection must qualify as prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** (e.g., *Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg.
 Co.,* 810 F.2d 1561, 1568, 1 USPQ2d 1593, 1597 (Fed. Cir. 1987)
 (“Before answering *Graham’s* ‘content’ inquiry, it must be
 known whether a patent or publication is in the prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 § 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.”)) and must also be analogous art to the claimed
 invention. See **[MPEP § 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208803)**. 

In the case of a prior art reference disclosing a genus,
 Office personnel should make findings as to: 

- (A) the structure of the disclosed prior art genus and that
 of any expressly described species or subgenus within the genus;
- (B) any physical or chemical properties and utilities
 disclosed for the genus, as well as any suggested limitations on the
 usefulness of the genus, and any problems alleged to be addressed by the
 genus;
- (C) the predictability of the technology; and
- (D) the number of species encompassed by the genus taking
 into consideration all of the variables possible.
**2.** **Ascertain the Differences Between the Closest Disclosed Prior Art
 Species or Subgenus of Record and the Claimed Species or Subgenus**

Once the structure of the disclosed prior art genus and that
 of any expressly described species or subgenus within the genus are identified,
 Office personnel should compare it to the claimed species or subgenus to
 determine the differences. Through this comparison, the closest disclosed
 species or subgenus in the prior art reference should be identified and
 compared to that claimed. Office personnel should make explicit findings on the
 similarities and differences between the closest disclosed prior art species or
 subgenus of record and the claimed species or subgenus including findings
 relating to similarity of structure, properties and utilities. In *Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp.,* 713 F.2d 1530, 1537,
 218 USPQ 871, 877 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court noted that “the question under **[35 U.S.C.
 § 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is not whether the differences [between the claimed
 invention and the prior art] would have been obvious” but “whether the claimed
 invention *as a whole* would have been obvious.” (emphasis in
 original). 

**3.** **Determine the Level of Skill in the Art**

Office personnel should evaluate the prior art from the
 standpoint of the hypothetical person having ordinary skill in the art at the
 time the claimed invention was made. See, *Ryko Mfg. Co. v.**Nu-Star Inc.,* 950 F.2d 714, 718, 21 USPQ2d 1053, 1057 (Fed.
 Cir. 1991) (“The importance of resolving the level of ordinary skill in the art
 lies in the necessity of maintaining objectivity in the obviousness inquiry.”); *Uniroyal Inc. v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp.,* 837 F.2d 1044, 1050,
 5 USPQ2d 1434, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (evidence must be viewed from position of
 ordinary skill, not of an expert). In most cases, the only facts of record
 pertaining to the level of skill in the art will be found within the prior art
 reference and a discussion of the level of ordinary skill will not be needed.
 See **[MPEP §
 2141.03](s2142.html#d0e209393)**, subsection II. However, any additional
 evidence presented by applicant should be evaluated. See **[MPEP §§
 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)**, subsection II, and **[2141.03](s2141.html#d0e209300)**,
 subsection III. 

**4.** **Determine Whether One of Ordinary Skill in the Art Would Have Had a
 Reason To Select the Claimed Species or Subgenus**

In light of the findings made relating to the *Graham* factors, Office personnel should determine whether
 it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art to make
 the claimed invention as a whole, i.e., to select the claimed species or
 subgenus from the disclosed prior art genus. To address this key issue, Office
 personnel should consider all relevant prior art teachings, focusing on the
 following, where present. 

**(a)** **Consider the Size of the Genus**

Consider the size of the prior art genus, bearing in mind
 that size alone cannot support an obviousness rejection. There is no
 absolute correlation between the size of the prior art genus and a
 conclusion of obviousness. See, e.g., *Baird,* 16 F.3d at
 383, 29 USPQ2d at 1552. Thus, the mere fact that a prior art genus contains
 a small number of members does not create a *per se* rule
 of obviousness. Even where the genus contains a small number of members, the
 disclosed genus may not possess a recognizable class of compounds with
 common properties. This is a distinction between an obviousness rejection
 and an anticipation rejection. Contrast the obviousness consideration with
 an anticipation rejection where it is clear that each member of the small
 genus contains common properties. A genus may be so small that, when
 considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, it would
 anticipate the claimed species or subgenus. For example, it has been held
 that a prior art genus containing only 20 compounds and a limited number of
 variations in the generic chemical formula inherently anticipated a claimed
 species within the genus because “one skilled in [the] art would... envisage *each member*” of the genus. *In re
 Petering,* 301 F.2d 676, 681, 133 USPQ 275, 280 (CCPA 1962)
 (emphasis in original). More specifically, the court in *Petering* stated: 
> A simple calculation will show that, excluding
> isomerism within certain of the R groups, the limited class we find in
> Karrer contains only 20 compounds. However, we wish to point out that it
> is not the mere number of compounds in this limited class which is
> significant here but, rather, the total circumstances involved, including
> such factors as the limited number of variations for R, only two
> alternatives for Y and Z, no alternatives for the other ring positions,
> and a large unchanging parent structural nucleus. With these
> circumstances in mind, it is our opinion that Karrer has described to
> those with ordinary skill in this art each of the various permutations
> here involved as fully as if he had drawn each structural formula or had
> written each name.

*Id.* (emphasis in original). *Accord In re
 Schaumann,* 572 F.2d 312, 316, 197 USPQ 5, 9 (CCPA 1978) (prior
 art genus encompassing claimed species which disclosed preference for lower
 alkyl secondary amines, as well as properties possessed by the claimed
 compound constituted description of claimed compound for purposes of **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**). *C.f.,**In re Ruschig,* 343 F.2d 965, 974, 145 USPQ 274, 282 (CCPA
 1965) (Rejection of claimed compound in light of prior art genus based on *Petering* is not appropriate where the prior art does
 not disclose a small recognizable class of compounds with common
 properties.). 

**(b)** **Consider the Express Teachings**

If the prior art reference expressly teaches a particular
 reason to select the claimed species or subgenus, Office personnel should
 point out the express disclosure and explain why it would have been obvious
 to one of ordinary skill in the art to select the claimed invention. An
 express teaching may be based on a statement in the prior art reference such
 as an art recognized equivalence. For example, see *Merck & Co.
 v. Biocraft Labs.,* 874 F.2d 804, 807, 10 USPQ2d 1843, 1846
 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (holding claims directed to diuretic compositions
 comprising a specific mixture of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide were
 obvious over a prior art reference expressly teaching that amiloride was a
 pyrazinoylguanidine which could be coadministered with potassium excreting
 diuretic agents, including hydrochlorothiazide which was a named example, to
 produce a diuretic with desirable sodium and potassium eliminating
 properties). See also, *In re Kemps,* 97 F.3d 1427, 1430,
 40 USPQ2d 1309, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding it would have been obvious to
 combine teachings of prior art to achieve claimed invention where one
 reference specifically refers to the other). 

**(c)** **Consider the Teachings of Structural Similarity**

Consider any teachings of a “typical,” “preferred,” or
 “optimum” species or subgenus within the disclosed genus. If such a prior
 art species or subgenus is structurally similar to that claimed, its
 disclosure may provide a reason for one of ordinary skill in the art to
 choose the claimed species or subgenus from the genus, based on the
 reasonable expectation that structurally similar species usually have
 similar properties. See, e.g., *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 693,
 696, 16 USPQ2d at 1901, 1904. See also *In re Deuel,* 51
 F.3d 1552, 1558, 34 USPQ2d 1210, 1214 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (“Structural
 relationships may provide the requisite motivation or suggestion to modify
 known compounds to obtain new compounds. For example, a prior art compound
 may suggest its homologs because homologs often have similar properties and
 therefore chemists of ordinary skill would ordinarily contemplate making
 them to try to obtain compounds with improved properties.”). 

In making an obviousness determination, Office personnel
 should consider the number of variables which must be selected or modified,
 and the nature and significance of the differences between the prior art and
 the claimed invention. See, e.g., *In re Jones,* 958 F.2d
 347, 350, 21 USPQ2d 1941, 1943 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (reversing obviousness
 rejection of novel dicamba salt with acyclic structure over broad prior art
 genus encompassing claimed salt, where disclosed examples of genus were
 dissimilar in structure, lacking an ether linkage or being cyclic); *In re Susi,* 440 F.2d 442, 445, 169 USPQ 423, 425 (CCPA
 1971) (the difference from the particularly preferred subgenus of the prior
 art was a hydroxyl group, a difference conceded by applicant “to be of
 little importance”). In the area of biotechnology, an exemplified species
 may differ from a claimed species by a conservative substitution (“the
 replacement in a protein of one amino acid by another, chemically similar,
 amino acid... [which] is generally expected to lead to either no change or
 only a small change in the properties of the protein.” *Dictionary
 of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology* 97 (John Wiley &
 Sons, 2d ed. 1989)). The effect of a conservative substitution on protein
 function depends on the nature of the substitution and its location in the
 chain. Although at some locations a conservative substitution may be benign,
 in some proteins only one amino acid is allowed at a given position. For
 example, the gain or loss of even one methyl group can destabilize the
 structure if close packing is required in the interior of domains. James
 Darnell *et al.,**Molecular Cell Biology* 51 (W. H. Freeman & Co., 2d
 ed. 1990). 

The closer the physical and/or chemical similarities
 between the claimed species or subgenus and any exemplary species or
 subgenus disclosed in the prior art, the greater the expectation that the
 claimed subject matter will function in an equivalent manner to the genus.
 See, e.g., *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 696, 16 USPQ2d at 1904
 (and cases cited therein). *Cf.**Baird,* 16 F.3d at 382-83, 29 USPQ2d at 1552 (disclosure
 of dissimilar species can provide teaching away). 

Similarly, consider any teaching or suggestion in the
 reference of a preferred species or subgenus that is significantly different
 in structure from the claimed species or subgenus. Such a teaching may weigh
 against selecting the claimed species or subgenus and thus against a
 determination of obviousness. *Baird,* 16 F.3d at 382-83,
 29 USPQ2d at 1552 (reversing obviousness rejection of species in view of
 large size of genus and disclosed “optimum” species which differed greatly
 from and were more complex than the claimed species); *Jones,* 958 F.2d at 350, 21 USPQ2d at 1943 (reversing
 obviousness rejection of novel dicamba salt with acyclic structure over
 broad prior art genus encompassing claimed salt, where disclosed examples of
 genus were dissimilar in structure, lacking an ether linkage or being
 cyclic). For example, teachings of preferred species of a complex nature
 within a disclosed genus may motivate an artisan of ordinary skill to make
 similar complex species and thus teach away from making simple species
 within the genus. *Baird,* 16 F.3d at 382, 29 USPQ2d at
 1552. See also *Jones,* 958 F.2d at 350, 21 USPQ2d at 1943
 (disclosed salts of genus held not sufficiently similar in structure to
 render claimed species *prima facie* obvious). 

Concepts used to analyze the structural similarity of
 chemical compounds in other types of chemical cases are equally useful in
 analyzing genus-species cases. For example, a claimed tetra-orthoester fuel
 composition was held to be obvious in light of a prior art tri-orthoester
 fuel composition based on their structural and chemical similarity and
 similar use as fuel additives. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at
 692-93, 16 USPQ2d at 1900-02. Likewise, claims to amitriptyline used as an
 antidepressant were held obvious in light of the structural similarity to
 imipramine, a known antidepressant prior art compound, where both compounds
 were tricyclic dibenzo compounds and differed structurally only in the
 replacement of the unsaturated carbon atom in the center ring of
 amitriptyline with a nitrogen atom in imipramine. *In re Merck &
 Co.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 1096-97, 231 USPQ 375, 378-79 (Fed. Cir.
 1986). Other structural similarities have been found to support a *prima facie* case of obviousness. See, e.g., *In re May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 1093-95, 197 USPQ 601,
 610-11 (CCPA 1978) (stereoisomers); *In re Wilder,* 563
 F.2d 457, 460, 195 USPQ 426, 429 (CCPA 1977) (adjacent homologs and
 structural isomers); *In re Hoch,* 428 F.2d 1341, 1344, 166
 USPQ 406, 409 (CCPA 1970) (acid and ethyl ester); *In re
 Druey,* 319 F.2d 237, 240, 138 USPQ 39, 41 (CCPA 1963) (omission
 of methyl group from pyrazole ring). Generally, some teaching of a
 structural similarity will be necessary to suggest selection of the claimed
 species or subgenus. *Id.*

**(d)** **Consider the Teachings of Similar Properties or Uses**

Consider the properties and utilities of the structurally
 similar prior art species or subgenus. It is the properties and utilities
 that provide real world motivation for a person of ordinary skill to make
 species structurally similar to those in the prior art. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 697, 16 USPQ2d at 1905; *In re Stemniski,* 444 F.2d 581, 586, 170 USPQ 343, 348
 (CCPA 1971). Conversely, lack of any known useful properties weighs against
 a finding of motivation to make or select a species or subgenus. *In
 re Albrecht,* 514 F.2d 1389, 1392, 1395-96, 185 USPQ 585, 587,
 590 (CCPA 1975) (The prior art compound so irritated the skin that it could
 not be regarded as useful for the disclosed anesthetic purpose, and
 therefore a person skilled in the art would not have been motivated to make
 related compounds.); *Stemniski,* 444 F.2d at 586, 170 USPQ
 at 348 (close structural similarity alone is not sufficient to create a *prima facie* case of obviousness when the reference
 compounds lack utility, and thus there is no motivation to make related
 compounds.). However, the prior art need not disclose a newly discovered
 property in order for there to be a *prima facie* case of
 obviousness. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 697, 16 USPQ2d at
 1904-05 (and cases cited therein). If the claimed invention and the
 structurally similar prior art species share any useful property, that
 will generally be sufficient to motivate an artisan of ordinary skill to
 make the claimed species, *e.g., id.* For example, based on
 a finding that a tri-orthoester and a tetra-orthoester behave similarly in
 certain chemical reactions, it has been held that one of ordinary skill in
 the relevant art would have been motivated to select either structure. 919
 F.2d at 692, 16 USPQ2d at 1900-01. In fact, similar properties may normally
 be presumed when compounds are very close in structure. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 693, 696, 16 USPQ2d at 1901, 1904.
 See also *In re Grabiak,* 769 F.2d 729, 731, 226 USPQ 870,
 871 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (“When chemical compounds have ‘very close’ structural
 similarities and similar utilities, without more a *prima
 facie* case may be made.”). Thus, evidence of similar properties
 or evidence of any useful properties disclosed in the prior art that would
 be expected to be shared by the claimed invention weighs in favor of a
 conclusion that the claimed invention would have been obvious. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 697-98, 16 USPQ2d at 1905; *In re Wilder,* 563 F.2d 457, 461, 195 USPQ 426,
 430 (CCPA 1977); *In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 1016, 173
 USPQ 560, 562 (CCPA 1972). 

**(e)** **Consider the Predictability of the Technology**

Consider the predictability of the technology. See, e.g., *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 692-97, 16 USPQ2d at 1901-05; *In re Grabiak,* 769 F.2d 729, 732-33, 226 USPQ 870, 872
 (Fed. Cir. 1985). If the technology is unpredictable, it is less likely that
 structurally similar species will render a claimed species obvious because
 it may not be reasonable to infer that they would share similar properties.
 See, e.g.*, In re May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 1094, 197 USPQ 601,
 611 (CCPA 1978) *(prima facie* obviousness of claimed
 analgesic compound based on structurally similar prior art isomer was
 rebutted with evidence demonstrating that analgesia and addiction properties
 could not be reliably predicted on the basis of chemical structure); *In re Schechter,* 205 F.2d 185, 191, 98 USPQ 144, 150
 (CCPA 1953) (unpredictability in the insecticide field, with homologs,
 isomers and analogs of known effective insecticides having proven
 ineffective as insecticides, was considered as a factor weighing against a
 conclusion of obviousness of the claimed compounds). However, obviousness
 does not require absolute predictability, only a reasonable expectation of
 success, i.e., a reasonable expectation of obtaining similar properties.
 See*,* e.g.*,**In re O’Farrell,* 853 F.2d 894, 903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681
 (Fed. Cir. 1988). 

**(f)** **Consider Any Other Teaching To Support the Selection of the Species
 or Subgenus**

The categories of relevant teachings enumerated above are
 those most frequently encountered in a genus-species case, but they are not
 exclusive. Office personnel should consider the totality of the evidence in
 each case. In unusual cases, there may be other relevant teachings
 sufficient to support the selection of the species or subgenus and,
 therefore, a conclusion of obviousness. 

**5.** **Make Express Fact-Findings and Determine Whether They Support a *Prima Facie* Case of Obviousness**

Based on the evidence as a whole *(In re
 Bell,* 991 F.2d 781,784, 26 USPQ2d 1529, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1993); *In re Kulling,* 897 F.2d 1147, 1149, 14 USPQ2d 1056, 1057
 (Fed. Cir. 1990)), Office personnel should make express fact-findings relating
 to the *Graham* factors, focusing primarily on the prior art
 teachings discussed above. The fact-findings should specifically articulate any
 teachings or suggestions in the prior art that would have motivated one of
 ordinary skill in the art to select the claimed species or subgenus. *Kulling,* 897 F.2d at 1149, 14 USPQ2d at 1058; *Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co.,* 810 F.2d 1561, 1579
 n.42, 1 USQP2d 1593, 1606 n.42 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The fact-findings should state
 a rationale, as required by *KSR,* that supports a conclusion
 that the claimed invention would have been obvious. Thereafter, it should be
 determined whether these findings, considered as a whole, establish a *prima facie* case that the claimed invention would have
 been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the relevant time.

 relevant time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at
 the time of the invention.]*

**I.** **REJECTION BASED ON CLOSE STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY IS FOUNDED ON THE EXPECTATION
 THAT COMPOUNDS SIMILAR IN STRUCTURE WILL HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES**

A *prima facie* case of obviousness may be made
 when chemical compounds have very close structural similarities and similar
 utilities. “An obviousness rejection based on similarity in chemical structure and
 function entails the motivation of one skilled in the art to make a claimed compound,
 in the expectation that compounds similar in structure will have similar properties.” *In re**Payne,* 606 F.2d 303, 313, 203 USPQ 245, 254 (CCPA 1979). See *In re**Papesch,* 315 F.2d 381, 137 USPQ 43 (CCPA 1963) (discussed in more
 detail below) and *In re**Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (discussed
 below and in **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**) for an extensive review of the case law pertaining to
 obviousness based on close structural similarity of chemical compounds. See also **[MPEP
 § 2144.08](s2144.html#d0e211596)**, subsection II.A.4.(c). 

**II.** **HOMOLOGY AND ISOMERISM ARE FACTS WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED WITH ALL OTHER
 RELEVANT FACTS IN DETERMINING OBVIOUSNESS**

Compounds which are position isomers (compounds having the same
 radicals in physically different positions on the same nucleus) or homologs
 (compounds differing regularly by the successive addition of the same chemical group,
 e.g., by -CH2- groups) are generally of sufficiently close
 structural similarity that there is a presumed expectation that such compounds
 possess similar properties. *In re**Wilder,* 563 F.2d 457, 195 USPQ 426 (CCPA 1977). See also *In re**May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 197 USPQ 601 (CCPA 1978) (stereoisomers *prima facie* obvious); *Aventis Pharma Deutschland v.
 Lupin Ltd.,* 499 F.3d 1293, 84 USPQ2d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (5(S)
 stereoisomer of ramipril obvious over prior art mixture of stereoisomers of
 ramipril.). 

Isomers having the same empirical formula but different structures
 are not necessarily considered equivalent by chemists skilled in the art and
 therefore are not necessarily suggestive of each other. *Ex parte**Mowry,* 91 USPQ 219 (Bd. App. 1950) (claimed cyclohexylstyrene not *prima facie* obvious over prior art isohexylstyrene). Similarly,
 homologs which are far removed from adjacent homologs may not be expected to have
 similar properties. *In re**Mills,* 281 F.2d 218, 221 126 USPQ 513, 516 (CCPA 1960) (in the
 absence of “some way to bridge the factual gap between” them, prior art disclosure of
 C(8) to C(12) alkyl sulfates was not sufficient to render *prima
 facie* obvious claimed C(1) alkyl sulfate). 

Homology and isomerism involve close structural similarity which
 must be considered with all other relevant facts in determining the issue of
 obviousness. *In re**Mills,* 281 F.2d 218, 126 USPQ 513 (CCPA 1960); *In
 re**Wiechert,* 370 F.2d 927, 152 USPQ 247 (CCPA 1967). Homology should
 not be automatically equated with *prima facie* obviousness because
 the claimed invention and the prior art must each be viewed “as a whole.” *In
 re Langer,* 465 F.2d 896, 175 USPQ 169 (CCPA 1972) (Claims to a
 polymerization process using a sterically hindered amine were held nonobvious over a
 similar prior art process because the prior art disclosed a large number of
 unhindered amines and only one sterically hindered amine (which differed from a
 claimed amine by 3 carbon atoms), and therefore the reference as a whole did not
 apprise the ordinary artisan of the significance of hindered amines as a class.). 

**III.** **PRESENCE OF A TRUE HOMOLOGOUS OR ISOMERIC RELATIONSHIP IS NOT
 CONTROLLING**

Prior art structures do not have to be true homologs or isomers to
 render structurally similar compounds *prima facie* obvious. *In re**Payne,* 606 F.2d 303, 203 USPQ 245 (CCPA 1979) (Claimed and prior
 art compounds were both directed to heterocyclic carbamoyloximino compounds having
 pesticidal activity. The only structural difference between the claimed and prior art
 compounds was that the ring structures of the claimed compounds had two carbon atoms
 between two sulfur atoms whereas the prior art ring structures had either one or
 three carbon atoms between two sulfur atoms. The court held that although the prior
 art compounds were not true homologs or isomers of the claimed compounds, the
 similarity between the chemical structures and properties is sufficiently close that
 one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to make the claimed
 compounds in searching for new pesticides.). 

See also *In re Mayne,* 104 F.3d 1339, 41 USPQ2d
 1451 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (claimed protein was held to be obvious in light of structural
 similarities to the prior art, including known structural and functional similarity
 of the amino acids leucine and isoleucine); *In re Merck & Co.,
 Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (claimed and prior
 art compounds used in a method of treating depression would have been expected to
 have similar activity because the structural difference between the compounds
 involved a known bioisosteric replacement); *In re**Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (The
 tri-orthoester fuel compositions of the prior art and the claimed tetra-orthoester
 fuel compositions would have been expected to have similar properties based on close
 structural and chemical similarity between the orthoesters and the fact that both the
 prior art and applicant used the orthoesters as fuel additives.) (See **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)** for a more detailed discussion of the facts in the *Dillon* case.). 

Compare *In re**Grabiak,* 769 F.2d 729, 226 USPQ 871 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (substitution
 of a thioester group for an ester group in an herbicidal safener compound was not
 suggested by the prior art); *In re**Bell,* 991 F.2d 781, 26 USPQ2d 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (The
 established relationship between a nucleic acid and the protein it encodes in the
 genetic code does not render a gene *prima facie* obvious over its
 corresponding protein in the same way that closely related structures in chemistry
 may create a *prima facie* case because there are a vast number of
 nucleotide sequences that might encode for a specific protein as a result of
 degeneracy in the genetic code (i.e., the fact that most amino acids are specified by
 more than one nucleotide sequence or codon).); *In re**Deuel,* 51 F.3d 1552, 1558-59, 34 USPQ2d 1210, 1215 (Fed. Cir.
 1995) (“A prior art disclosure of the amino acid sequence of a protein does not
 necessarily render particular DNA molecules encoding the protein obvious because the
 redundancy of the genetic code permits one to hypothesize an enormous number of DNA
 sequences coding for the protein.” The existence of a general method of gene cloning
 in the prior art is not sufficient, without more, to render obvious a particular cDNA
 molecule.). 

**IV.** **PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF PRIOR ART SUGGESTION OF METHOD OF MAKING A CLAIMED
 COMPOUND MAY BE RELEVANT IN DETERMINING *PRIMA FACIE* OBVIOUSNESS**

“[T]he presence—or absence—of a suitably operative, obvious process
 for making a composition of matter may have an ultimate bearing on whether that
 composition is obvious—or nonobvious—under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *In re
 Maloney,* 411 F.2d 1321, 1323, 162 USPQ 98, 100 (CCPA 1969). 

“[I]f the prior art of record fails to disclose or render obvious a
 method for making a claimed compound, at the time the invention was made, it may not
 be legally concluded that the compound itself is in the possession of the public. In
 this context, we say that the absence of a known or obvious process for making the
 claimed compounds overcomes a presumption that the compounds are obvious, based on
 the close relationships between their structures and those of prior art compounds.” *In re**Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d 269, 274-75, 158 USPQ 597, 601 (CCPA 1968). 

See *In re**Payne,* 606 F.2d 303, 203 USPQ 245 (CCPA 1979) for a general
 discussion of circumstances under which the prior art suggests methods for making
 novel compounds which are of close structural similarity to compounds known in the
 prior art. It may be proper to apply “methodology in rejecting product claims under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, depending on the particular facts of the case, the manner
 and context in which methodology applies, and the overall logic of the rejection.” *Ex parte Goldgaber,* 41 USPQ2d 1172, 1176 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1996). 

**V.** **PRESUMPTION OF OBVIOUSNESS BASED ON STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY IS OVERCOME WHERE
 THERE IS NO REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF SIMILAR PROPERTIES**

The presumption of obviousness based on a reference disclosing
 structurally similar compounds may be overcome where there is evidence showing there
 is no reasonable expectation of similar properties in structurally similar compounds. *In re**May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 197 USPQ 601 (CCPA 1978) (appellant produced
 sufficient evidence to establish a substantial degree of unpredictability in the
 pertinent art area, and thereby rebutted the presumption that structurally similar
 compounds have similar properties); *In re**Schechter,* 205 F.2d 185, 98 USPQ 144 (CCPA 1953). See also *Ex parte Blattner,* 2 USPQ2d 2047 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1987) (Claims directed to compounds containing a 7-membered ring were rejected as *prima facie* obvious over a reference which taught 5- and
 6-membered ring homologs of the claimed compounds. The Board reversed the rejection
 because the prior art taught that the compounds containing a 5-membered ring
 possessed the opposite utility of the compounds containing the 6-membered ring,
 undermining the examiner’s asserted *prima facie* case arising from
 an expectation of similar results in the claimed compounds which contain a 7-membered
 ring.). 

**VI.** **IF PRIOR ART COMPOUNDS HAVE NO UTILITY, OR UTILITY ONLY AS INTERMEDIATES,
 CLAIMED STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR COMPOUNDS MAY NOT BE *PRIMA FACIE* OBVIOUS OVER THE PRIOR ART**

If the prior art does not teach any specific
 or significant utility for the disclosed compounds, then the prior art is unlikely to
 render structurally similar claims *prima facie* obvious in the
 absence of any reason for one of ordinary skill in the art to make the reference
 compounds or any structurally related compounds. *In re**Stemniski,* 444 F.2d 581, 170 USPQ 343 (CCPA 1971). 

See also*In re**Albrecht,* 514 F.2d 1389, 1396, 185 USPQ 585, 590 (CCPA 1975)
 (prior art reference studied the local anesthetic activity of various compounds, and
 taught that compounds structurally similar to those claimed were irritating to human
 skin and therefore “cannot be regarded as useful anesthetics.” 514 F.2d at 1393, 185
 USPQ at 587). 

Similarly, if the prior art merely discloses compounds as
 intermediates in the production of a final product, one of ordinary skill in the art
 would not ordinarily stop the reference synthesis and investigate the intermediate
 compounds with an expectation of arriving at claimed compounds which have different
 uses. *In re**Lalu,* 747 F.2d 703, 223 USPQ 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 

**VII.** ***PRIMA FACIE* CASE REBUTTABLE BY EVIDENCE OF UNEXPECTED
 RESULTS**

A *prima facie* case of obviousness based on
 structural similarity is rebuttable by proof that the claimed compounds possess
 unexpectedly advantageous or superior properties. *In re**Papesch,* 315 F.2d 381, 137 USPQ 43 (CCPA 1963) (affidavit evidence
 which showed that claimed triethylated compounds possessed anti-inflammatory activity
 whereas prior art trimethylated compounds did not was sufficient to overcome
 obviousness rejection based on the homologous relationship between the prior art and
 claimed compounds); *In re**Wiechert,* 370 F.2d 927, 152 USPQ 247 (CCPA 1967) (a 7-fold
 improvement of activity over the prior art held sufficient to rebut *prima
 facie* obviousness based on close structural similarity). 

However, a claimed compound may be obvious because it was suggested
 by, or structurally similar to, a prior art compound even though a particular benefit
 of the claimed compound asserted by patentee is not expressly disclosed in the prior
 art. It is the differences, in fact, in their respective properties which are
 determinative of nonobviousness. If the prior art compound does in fact possess a
 particular benefit, even though the benefit is not recognized in the prior art,
 applicant’s recognition of the benefit is not in itself sufficient to distinguish the
 claimed compound from the prior art. *In re Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688,
 693, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1901 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (*en banc*). 

See **[MPEP § 716.02](s716.html#d0e92844)** - **[§ 716.02(g)](s716.html#d0e93296)** for a discussion of
 evidence alleging unexpectedly advantageous or superior results.

# 2145 Consideration of Applicant’s Rebuttal Arguments and Evidence [R-01.2024]

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an application
 is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject to the first
 inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is "before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the invention". See **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. Many of the court decisions discussed in this
 section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These court
 decisions may be applicable to applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** but the relevant time is before the effective filing date of
 the claimed invention and not at the time of the invention.]*

If a *prima facie* case of obviousness is established,
 the burden shifts to the applicant to come forward with arguments and/or evidence to rebut
 the *prima facie* case. See, e.g., *In re Dillon,* 919
 F.2d 688, 692, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1901 (Fed. Cir. 1990) *(en banc).* Applicant may also present rebuttal evidence and arguments prior to an Office action in
 anticipation of possible prior art rejections. Examiners should consider all evidence of
 obviousness and nonobviousness of record before making a determination under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**. 

Rebuttal evidence and arguments can be presented in the
 specification, *In re Soni,* 54 F.3d 746, 750, 34 USPQ2d 1684, 1687 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995), by way of an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**, e.g., *Soni,* 54 F.3d at 750, 34 USPQ2d at 1687; *In re
 Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 1474, 223 USPQ 785, 789-90 (Fed. Cir. 1984), or
 otherwise presented during prosecution. See, e.g., **[MPEP §§ 714](s714.html#d0e85040)** to **[716](s716.html#d0e92085)***et seq.* However, arguments presented by applicant cannot take the place
 of factually supported objective evidence. See, e.g., *In re Schulze,* 346
 F.2d 600, 602, 145 USPQ 716, 718 (CCPA 1965); *In re De Blauwe,* 736 F.2d
 699, 705, 222 USPQ 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 

Office personnel should consider all rebuttal arguments and evidence
 presented by applicants. See, e.g.,  *Soni,* 54 F.3d at 750, 34 USPQ2d at
 1687 (error not to consider evidence presented in the specification). C.f., *In re
 Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1067, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1807 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“[W]hen
 secondary considerations are present, though they are not always dispositive, it is error
 not to consider them.”); *In re Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 37 USPQ2d 1578 (Fed.
 Cir. 1996) (error not to consider factual evidence submitted to counter a **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** rejection); *In re Beattie,* 974 F.2d 1309, 1313, 24 USPQ2d 1040, 1042-43
 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Office personnel should consider declarations from those skilled in the
 art praising the claimed invention and opining that the art teaches away from the
 invention.); *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1472, 223 USPQ at 788 (“[Rebuttal
 evidence] may relate to any of the *Graham* factors including the
 so-called secondary considerations.”). The Federal Circuit has “emphasized that
 consideration of the objective indicia is part of the whole obviousness analysis, not just
 an afterthought.” *Leo Pharm. Prod., Ltd. v. Rea,* 726 F.3d 1346, 1357,
 107 USPQ2d 1943, 1952 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in original). Even though court decisions
 “have used the ‘prima facie’ and ‘rebuttal’ language [the decisions have] generally have
 made clear that a fact finder must consider *all* evidence of obviousness
 and nonobviousness before reaching a determination.” *In re Cyclobenzaprine
 Hydrochloride Extended- Release Capsule Patent Litig.,* 676 F.3d 1063, 1077,
 102 USPQ2d 1760, 1772 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (emphasis in the original). 

Rebuttal evidence may include evidence of “secondary considerations,” such
 as “commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, [and] failure of others.” *Graham v. John Deere Co.,* 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 4459, 467. See also,
 e.g., *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 1473, 223 USPQ 785, 788 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (commercial success). Rebuttal evidence may also include evidence that the claimed
 invention yields unexpectedly improved properties or properties not present in the prior
 art. Rebuttal evidence may consist of a showing that the claimed compound possesses
 unexpected properties. *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 692-93, 16 USPQ2d at 1901. A
 showing of unexpected results must be based on evidence, not argument or speculation. *In re Mayne,* 104 F.3d 1339, 1343-44, 41 USPQ2d 1451, 1455-56 (Fed.
 Cir. 1997) (conclusory statements regarding unusually low immune response or unexpected
 biological activity that were unsupported by comparative data held insufficient to overcome *prima facie* case of obviousness). Rebuttal evidence may include
 evidence that the claimed invention was copied by others. See, e.g., *In re
 GPAC,* 57 F.3d 1573, 1580, 35 USPQ2d 1116, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 1995); *Hybritech Inc.**v. Monoclonal Antibodies,* 802 F.2d 1367, 1380, 231 USPQ 81, 90 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). It may also include evidence of the state of the art, the level of skill in the
 art, and the beliefs of those skilled in the art. See, e.g., *In re Oelrich,* 579 F.2d 86, 91-92, 198 USPQ 210, 214 (CCPA 1978) (Expert opinions regarding the
 level of skill in the art were probative of the nonobviousness of the claimed invention.); *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1471, 1473-74, 223 USPQ at 790 (Evidence of
 nontechnological nature is pertinent to the conclusion of obviousness. The declarations of
 those skilled in the art regarding the need for the invention and its reception by the art
 were improperly discounted by the Board.); *Beattie,* 974 F.2d at 1313, 24
 USPQ2d at 1042-43 (Seven declarations provided by music teachers opining that the art
 teaches away from the claimed invention must be considered, but were not probative because
 they did not contain facts and did not deal with the specific prior art that was the
 subject of the rejection.). For example, rebuttal evidence may include a showing that the
 prior art fails to disclose or render obvious a method for making the compound, which would
 preclude a conclusion of obviousness of the compound. A conclusion of obviousness requires
 that the reference(s) relied upon, together with the knowledge of a person skilled in the
 art, be enabling in that it put the public in possession of the claimed invention. *In re Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d 269, 273, 158 USPQ 596, 600 (CCPA 1968)
 (citing *In re Le Grice,* 301 F.2d 929, 936, 133 USPQ 365, 372 (CCPA
 1962)). The *Hoeksema,* court stated: 
> Thus, upon careful reconsideration it is our view that if the prior
> art of record fails to disclose or render obvious a method for making a claimed
> compound, at the time the invention was made, it may not be legally concluded that the

> between their structures and those of prior art compounds.

See *Hoeksema*, 399 F.2d at 274, 158 USPQ at 601. The *Hoeksema* court further noted that once a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness is made by the USPTO through citation of references,
 the burden is on the applicant to produce contrary evidence. In *Hoeksema*, the contrary evidence was that the applied reference did not
 disclose or render obvious a process for producing the claimed compounds. *Id.* at 274-75, 158 USPQ at 601. See also *Ashland Oil, Inc.
 v. Delta Resins & Refractories, Inc.,* 776 F.2d 281, 295, 297, 227 USPQ
 657, 666, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing *Hoeksema* for the proposition
 above); *In re Grose,* 592 F.2d 1161, 1168, 201 USPQ 57, 63-64 (CCPA 1979)
 ("One of the assumptions underlying a prima facie obviousness rejection based upon a
 structural relationship between compounds, such as adjacent homologs, is that a method
 disclosed for producing one would provide those skilled in the art with a method for
 producing the other... Failure of the prior art to disclose or render obvious a method for
 making any composition of matter, whether a compound or a mixture of compounds like a
 zeolite, precludes a conclusion that the composition would have been obvious."). 

Consideration of rebuttal evidence and arguments requires Office personnel
 to weigh the proffered evidence and arguments. *Id.;* see also *In
 re Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 1174-75, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
 Office personnel should avoid giving no weight to evidence submitted by applicant, except
 in rare circumstances. However, to be entitled to substantial weight, the applicant should
 establish a nexus between the rebuttal evidence and the claimed invention, i.e., objective
 evidence of nonobviousness must be attributable to the claimed invention. The Federal
 Circuit has acknowledged that applicant bears the burden of establishing nexus,
 stating: 
> In the *ex parte* process of examining a patent
> application, however, the PTO lacks the means or resources to gather evidence which
> supports or refutes the applicant’s assertion that the sales constitute commercial
> success. *C.f. Ex parte Remark,* 15 USPQ2d 1498, 1503 ([BPAI] 1990)
> (evidentiary routine of shifting burdens in civil proceedings inappropriate in *ex parte* prosecution proceedings because examiner has no available
> means for adducing evidence). Consequently, the PTO must rely upon the applicant to
> provide hard evidence of commercial success.

*In re Huang,* 100 F.3d 135, 139-40, 40 USPQ2d 1685, 1689 (Fed. Cir.
 1996). See also *GPAC,* 57 F.3d at 1580, 35 USPQ2d at 1121; *In re
 Paulsen,* 30 F.3d 1475, 1482, 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1676 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Evidence
 of commercial success of articles not covered by the claims subject to the **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection was not probative of nonobviousness.). Additionally,
 the evidence must be reasonably commensurate in scope with the claimed invention. See,
 e.g., *In re Kulling,* 897 F.2d 1147, 1149, 14 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed.
 Cir. 1990); *In re Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731, 743, 218 USPQ 769, 777 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983). *In re Soni,* 54 F.3d 746, 34 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
 does not change this analysis. In *Soni,* the court declined to consider
 the Office’s argument that the evidence of nonobviousness was not commensurate in scope
 with the claim because it had not been raised by the examiner. *Id.* 54
 F.3d at 751, 34 USPQ2d at 1688. 

In other words, in order for evidence of secondary
 considerations to be accorded substantial weight, there must be a nexus, i.e., a legally
 and factually sufficient connection or correspondence between the submitted evidence and
 the claimed invention. *Fox Factory, Inc. v. SRAM, LLC,* 944 F.3d 1366,
 1373, 2019 USPQ2d 483355 (Fed. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 373 (2020). “A
 presumption of nexus requires both that the product embodies the invention and is
 coextensive with it.” *Volvo Penta of the Americas, LLC v. Brunswick
 Corp.,* 81 F.4th 1202,1211-12, 2023 USPQ2d 1000 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (While Volvo
 Penta provided insufficient evidence to show a presumption of nexus, they did provide
 sufficient evidence to show nexus, independent of the presumption, through evidence of
 commercial success and copying due to the unique features of the claimed invention.). See **[MPEP §
 716.01(b)](s716.html#d0e92626)**. 

When considering whether proffered evidence is commensurate in scope with
 the claimed invention, Office personnel should not require the applicant to show
 unexpected results over the entire range of properties possessed by a chemical compound or
 composition. See, e.g., *In re Chupp,* 816 F.2d 643, 646, 2 USPQ2d 1437,
 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Evidence that the compound or composition possesses superior and
 unexpected properties in one of a spectrum of common properties can be sufficient to rebut
 a *prima facie* case of obviousness. *Id.*

For example, a showing of unexpected results for a single member of a
 claimed subgenus, or a narrow portion of a claimed range would be sufficient to rebut a *prima facie* case of obviousness if a skilled artisan “could ascertain
 a trend in the exemplified data that would allow him to reasonably extend the probative
 value thereof.” *In re Clemens,* 622 F.2d 1029, 1036, 206 USPQ 289, 296
 (CCPA 1980) (Evidence of the nonobviousness of a broad range can be proven by a narrower
 range when one skilled in the art could ascertain a trend that would allow him to
 reasonably extend the probative value thereof.). But see, *Grasselli,* 713
 F.2d at 743, 218 USPQ at 778 (evidence of superior properties for sodium containing
 composition insufficient to establish the non-obviousness of broad claims for a catalyst
 with “an alkali metal” where it was well known in the catalyst art that different alkali
 metals were not interchangeable and applicant had shown unexpected results only for sodium
 containing materials); *In re Greenfield,* 571 F.2d 1185, 1189, 197 USPQ
 227, 230 (CCPA 1978) (evidence of superior properties in one species insufficient to
 establish the nonobviousness of a subgenus containing hundreds of compounds); *In
 re Lindner,* 457 F.2d 506, 508, 173 USPQ 356, 358 (CCPA 1972) (one test not
 sufficient where there was no adequate basis for concluding the other claimed compounds
 would behave the same way). However, an exemplary showing may be sufficient to establish a
 reasonable correlation between the showing and the entire scope of the claim, when viewed
 by a skilled artisan. See, e.g., *Chupp,* 816 F.2d at 646, 2 USPQ2d at
 1439; *Clemens,* 622 F.2d at 1036, 206 USPQ at 296. On the other hand,
 evidence of an unexpected property may not be sufficient regardless of the scope of the
 showing. Usually, a showing of unexpected results is sufficient to overcome a *prima facie* case of obviousness. See, e.g., *In re
 Albrecht,* 514 F.2d 1389, 1396, 185 USPQ 585, 590 (CCPA 1975). However, where
 the claims are not limited to a particular use, and where the prior art provides other
 motivation to select a particular species or subgenus, a showing of a new use alone may not
 be sufficient to confer patentability. See *Dillon,* 919 F.2d at 692, 16
 USPQ2d at 1900-01. Accordingly, each case should be evaluated individually based on the
 totality of the circumstances. 

Evidence pertaining to secondary considerations must be taken into
 account whenever it has been properly presented; however, it does not necessarily control
 the obviousness conclusion. See, e.g., *Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc.,* 480
 F.3d 1348, 1372, 82 USPQ2d 1321, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“the record establish[ed] such a
 strong case of obviousness” that allegedly unexpectedly superior results were ultimately
 insufficient to overcome obviousness conclusion); *Leapfrog Enterprises Inc. v.
 Fisher-Price Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 1162, 82 USPQ2d 1687, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
 (“given the strength of the *prima facie* obviousness showing, the
 evidence on secondary considerations was inadequate to overcome a final conclusion” of
 obviousness); and *Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney Mfg. Co.,* 864 F.2d 757,
 768, 9 USPQ2d 1417, 1426 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Office personnel should not evaluate rebuttal
 evidence for its “knockdown” value against the *prima facie* case, *Piasecki,* 745 F.2d at 1473, 223 USPQ at 788, or summarily dismiss it
 as not compelling or insufficient. Office personnel should weigh all relevant evidence of
 record in order to determine whether the claims would have been obvious based on a
 preponderance (more likely than not) standard, and then explain their conclusions. See **[MPEP §
 716](s716.html#d0e92085)** - **[§ 716.10](s716.html#d0e93797)** for additional information
 pertaining to the evaluation of rebuttal evidence submitted under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**. 

The following cases exemplify the continued application of
 the principle that when evidence has been presented to rebut an obviousness rejection, it
 should not be evaluated simply for its “knockdown” value. Rather, all evidence must be
 reweighed to determine whether the claims are nonobvious. 

**Example 1:**

The claims at issue in *PharmaStem Therapeutics,
 Inc. v. Viacell, Inc.,* 491 F.3d 1342, 83 USPQ2d 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2007), were
 directed to compositions comprising hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord or
 placental blood, and to methods of using such compositions for treatment of blood and
 immune system disorders. The composition claims required that the stem cells be present
 in an amount sufficient to effect hematopoietic reconstitution when administered to a
 human adult. The trial court had found that PharmaStem’s patents were infringed and not
 invalid on obviousness or other grounds. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the
 district court, determining that the claims were invalid for obviousness. 

The Federal Circuit discussed the evidence presented at
 trial. It pointed out that the patentee, PharmaStem, had not invented an entirely new
 procedure or new composition. Rather, PharmaStem’s own specification acknowledged that
 it was already known in the prior art that umbilical cord and placental blood-based
 compositions contained hematopoietic stem cells, and that hematopoietic stem cells were
 useful for the purpose of hematopoietic reconstitution. PharmaStem’s contribution was to
 provide experimental proof that umbilical cord and placental blood could be used to
 effect hematopoietic reconstitution in mice. By extrapolation, one of ordinary skill in
 the art would have expected this reconstitution method to work in humans as well. 

The court rejected PharmaStem’s expert testimony that
 hematopoietic stem cells had not been proved to exist in cord blood prior to the
 experiments described in PharmaStem’s patents. The court explained that the expert
 testimony was contrary to the inventors’ admissions in the specification, as well as
 prior art teachings that disclosed stem cells in cord blood. In this case, PharmaStem’s
 evidence of nonobviousness was outweighed by contradictory evidence. 

Despite PharmaStem’s useful experimental validation of
 hematopoietic reconstitution using hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord and
 placental blood, the Federal Circuit found that the claims at issue would have been
 obvious. There had been ample suggestion in the prior art that the claimed method would
 have worked. Absolute predictability is not a necessary prerequisite to a case of
 obviousness. Rather, a degree of predictability that one of ordinary skill would have
 found to be reasonable is sufficient. The Federal Circuit concluded that “[g]ood science
 and useful contributions do not necessarily result in patentability.” *Id.* at 1364, 83 USPQ2d at 1304. 

**Example 2:**

It was found to be an error in *In re
 Sullivan,* 498 F.3d 1345, 84 USPQ2d 1034 (Fed. Cir. 2007), for the Board to
 fail to consider evidence submitted to rebut a *prima facie* case of
 obviousness. 

The claimed invention was directed to an antivenom
 composition comprising F(ab) fragments used to treat venomous rattlesnake bites. The
 composition was created from antibody molecules that include three fragments, F(ab)2,
 F(ab) and F(c), which have separate properties and utilities. There had been
 commercially available antivenom products that consisted of whole antibodies and F(ab)2
 fragments, but researchers had not experimented with antivenoms containing only F(ab)
 fragments because it was believed that their unique properties would prevent them from
 decreasing the toxicity of snake venom. The inventor, Sullivan, discovered that F(ab)
 fragments are effective at neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom, while
 reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans. On appeal of the
 examiner’s rejection, the Board held that the claim was obvious because all the elements
 of the claimed composition were accounted for in the prior art, and that the composition
 taught by that prior art would have been expected by a person of ordinary skill in the
 art at the time the invention was made (the case was examined under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**) to neutralize the lethality of the venom of a rattlesnake. 

Rebuttal evidence had not been considered by the Board
 because it considered the evidence to relate to the intended use of the claimed
 composition as an antivenom, rather than the composition itself. Appellant successfully
 argued that even if the Board had shown a *prima facie* case of
 obviousness, the extensive rebuttal evidence must be considered. The evidence included
 three expert declarations submitted to show that the prior art taught away from the
 claimed invention, an unexpected property or result from the use of F(ab) fragment
 antivenom, and why those having ordinary skill in the art expected antivenoms comprising
 F(ab) fragments to fail. The declarations related to more than the use of the claimed
 composition. While a statement of intended use may not render a known composition
 patentable, the claimed composition was not known, and whether it would have been
 obvious depends upon consideration of the rebuttal evidence. Appellant did not concede
 that the only distinguishing factor of its composition is the statement of intended use
 and extensively argued that its claimed composition exhibits the unexpected property of
 neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom while reducing the occurrence of adverse
 immune reactions in humans. The Federal Circuit found that such a use and unexpected
 property cannot be ignored – the unexpected property is relevant and thus the
 declarations describing it should have been considered. 

Nonobviousness can be shown when a person of ordinary
 skill in the art would not have reasonably predicted the claimed invention based on the
 prior art, and the resulting invention would not have been expected. All evidence must
 be considered when properly presented. 

**Example 3:**

The case of *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure
 Inc.,* 600 F.3d 1357, 94 USPQ2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2010), involved a disposable
 protective covering for the portion of a hearing aid that is inserted into the ear
 canal. The covering was such that it could be readily replaced by a user as needed. 

At the district court, Shure had argued that Hearing
 Components’ patents were obvious over one or more of three different combinations of
 prior art references. The jury disagreed, and determined that the claims were
 nonobvious. The district court upheld the jury verdict, stating that in view of the
 conflicting evidence presented by the parties as to the teachings of the references,
 motivation to combine, and secondary considerations, the nonobviousness verdict was
 sufficiently grounded in the evidence. 

Shure appealed to the Federal Circuit, but the Federal
 Circuit agreed with the district court that the jury’s nonobviousness verdict had been
 supported by substantial evidence. Although Shure had argued before the jury that the
 Carlisle reference taught an ear piece positioned inside the ear canal, Hearing
 Components’ credible witness countered that only the molded duct and not the ear piece
 itself was taught by Carlisle as being inside the ear canal. On the issue of combining
 references, Shure’s witness had given testimony described as “rather sparse, and lacking
 in specific details.” *Id.* at 1364, 94 USPQ2d at 1397. In
 contradistinction, Hearing Components’ witness “described particular reasons why one
 skilled in the art would not have been motivated to combine the references.” *Id.* Finally, as to secondary considerations, the Federal Circuit
 determined that Hearing Components had shown a nexus between the commercial success of
 its product and the patent by providing evidence that “the licensing fee for a covered
 product was more than cut in half immediately upon expiration” of the patent. 

Although the *Hearing Components* case
 involves substantial evidence of nonobviousness in a jury verdict, it is nevertheless
 instructive for Office personnel on the matter of weighing evidence. Office personnel
 routinely must consider evidence in the form of prior art references, statements in the
 specification, or declarations under **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** (for cases examined
 under the **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**), **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** (for cases examined under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**), or **[1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** (for cases examined either
 under the AIA or under pre-AIA law). Other forms of evidence may also be presented
 during prosecution. Office personnel are reminded that evidence that has been presented
 in a timely manner should not be ignored, but rather should be considered on the record.
 However, not all evidence need be accorded the same weight. In determining the relative
 weight to accord to rebuttal evidence, considerations such as whether a nexus exists
 between the claimed invention and the proffered evidence, and whether the evidence is
 commensurate in scope with the claimed invention, are appropriate. The mere presence of
 some credible rebuttal evidence does not dictate that an obviousness rejection must
 always be withdrawn. See **[MPEP § 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**. Office personnel must consider the appropriate
 weight to be accorded to each piece of evidence. An obviousness rejection should be made
 or maintained only if evidence of obviousness outweighs evidence of nonobviousness. See **[MPEP §
 706](s706.html#d0e57969)**, subsection I. (“The standard to be applied in all cases
 is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ test. In other words, an examiner should reject a
 claim if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not
 that the claim is unpatentable.”). **[MPEP § 716.01(d)](s716.html#d0e92769)** provides further
 guidance on weighing evidence in making a determination of patentability. 

**Example 4:**

*Yita LLC, v MacNeil IP LLC,* 69 F.4th
 1356, 2023 USPQ2d 667 (Fed. Cir. 2023) involved consideration of Yita’s challenge to
 MacNeil’s patent in two *inter partes* reviews (IPRs). In
 IPR2020-01139, the Board found the patent claims nonobvious due to MacNeil’s “evidence
 of secondary considerations [which was] compelling and indicative of non-obviousness.”
 On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board’s final written decision. 

MacNeil’s patent claims were directed to a vehicle floor
 tray “closely conforming” to certain walls of the vehicle foot well, a feature that the
 Board recognized was disclosed in one of the asserted prior art references (Rabbe). The
 Board had found that MacNeil was entitled to a presumption of nexus because its marketed
 vehicle trays embodied the claimed invention and were coextensive with the claims. 

On appeal, the Federal Circuit determined that the
 finding of nexus rested on two legal errors: (1) the finding that Rabbe’s disclosure
 needed to but did not establish that close conformance was well-known; and (2) the
 misapplication of *WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co.,* 829 F.3d 1317, 119 USPQ2d
 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2016), which did not speak to the present situation where the secondary
 consideration evidence is linked to an individual element of the claimed invention,
 specifically the close-conformity element taught by Rabbe. 

As to the first error, the court determined that their
 previous case law made clear that “objective evidence of nonobviousness lacks a nexus if
 it exclusively relates to a feature that was ‘known in the prior art’—not necessarily
 well-known.” *Rambus Inc. v. Rea,* 731 F.3d 1248, 1257, 108 USPQ2d 1400
 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in the original) (quoting *Ormco Corp. v. Align
 Technology, Inc.,* 463 F.3d 1299, 1312, 79 USPQ2d 1931 (Fed. Cir. 2006))
 (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the court noted that the finding of
 coextensiveness is only relevant to the presumption of nexus and it alone does not
 decide the overall nexus question. 

As to the second error, the court determined the
 secondary consideration evidence was related solely to the individual element of
 close-conformance disclosed in the prior art to Rabbe. This circumstance was different
 than the one present in *WBIP* in which no single feature (but only the
 combination) was responsible for the secondary consideration evidence. 

The secondary consideration evidence was the only *Graham* factor that the Board deemed to weigh in favor of
 nonobviousness. Because the Board determined that an artisan of ordinary skill would
 have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to arrive at
 the claimed invention with a reasonable expectation of success, the court reversed the
 final written decision. 

**[MPEP § 716.01(b)](s716.html#d0e92626)** provides further
 guidance on the nexus requirement and evidence of nonobviousness. 

See **[MPEP § 2155](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_16784_56)** regarding affidavits or
 declarations under **[37
 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** to overcome prior art rejections. 

See **[MPEP §§ 715](s715.html#d0e89737)** et seq. and **[2136.05(a)](s2136.html#ch2100_d2c183_21160_34b)** regarding affidavits or declarations under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to overcome prior art rejections. 

See **[MPEP §§ 716](s716.html#d0e92085)** et seq. and **[2136.05(b)](s2136.html#ch2100_d2c183_211c7_5e)** regarding affidavits or declarations under **[37 CFR
 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** to overcome prior art rejections. 

**I.** **ARGUMENT DOES NOT REPLACE EVIDENCE WHERE EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY**

An argument by the applicant is not evidence unless it is an admission,
 in which case, an examiner may use the admission in making a rejection. See **[MPEP §
 2129](s2129.html#d0e202844)** and **[§ 2144.03](s2144.html#d0e210752)** for a discussion of
 admissions as prior art. 

Arguments presented by applicant cannot take the place of evidence in
 the record. See *In re De Blauwe,* 736 F.2d 699, 705, 222 USPQ 191, 196
 (Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re* *Schulze,* 346 F.2d 600, 602, 145 USPQ 716, 718 (CCPA 1965); *In re Geisler,* 116 F.3d 1465, 43 USPQ2d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“An
 assertion of what seems to follow from common experience is just attorney argument and
 not the kind of factual evidence that is required to rebut a *prima
 facie* case of obviousness.”). See **[MPEP § 716.01(c)](s716.html#d0e92659)** for examples of
 applicant statements which are not evidence and which must be supported by an
 appropriate affidavit or declaration. 

**II.** **ARGUING ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OR LATENT PROPERTIES**

-
***Prima Facie Obviousness Is Not Rebutted by Merely Recognizing Additional
 Advantages or Latent Properties Present But Not Recognized in the Prior
 Art***

Mere recognition of latent properties in the prior art does not
 render nonobvious an otherwise known invention. *In re Wiseman,* 596
 F.2d 1019, 201 USPQ 658 (CCPA 1979) (Claims were directed to grooved carbon disc
 brakes wherein the grooves were provided to vent steam or vapor during a braking
 action. A prior art reference taught noncarbon disc brakes which were grooved for the
 purpose of cooling the faces of the braking members and eliminating dust. The court
 held the prior art references when combined would overcome the problems of dust and
 overheating solved by the prior art and would inherently overcome the steam or vapor
 cause of the problem relied upon for patentability by applicants. Granting a patent
 on the discovery of an unknown but inherent function (here venting steam or vapor)
 “would remove from the public that which is in the public domain by virtue of its
 inclusion in, or obviousness from, the prior art.” 596 F.2d at 1022, 201 USPQ at
 661.); *In re Baxter Travenol Labs.,* 952 F.2d 388, 21 USPQ2d 1281
 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Appellant argued that the presence of DEHP as the plasticizer in a
 blood collection bag unexpectedly suppressed hemolysis and therefore rebutted any *prima facie* showing of obviousness. However, the closest prior
 art utilizing a DEHP plasticized blood collection bag inherently achieved same
 result, although this fact was unknown in the prior art.). 

“The fact that appellant has recognized another advantage which
 would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior art cannot be the
 basis for patentability when the differences would otherwise be obvious.” *Ex
 parte Obiaya,* 227 USPQ 58, 60 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985) (The
 prior art taught combustion fluid analyzers which used labyrinth heaters to maintain
 the samples at a uniform temperature. Although appellant showed that an unexpectedly
 shorter response time was obtained when a labyrinth heater was employed, the Board
 held this advantage would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior
 art.). See also  *Lantech Inc.**v. Kaufman Co. of Ohio Inc.,* 878 F.2d 1446, 12 USPQ2d 1076, 1077
 (Fed. Cir. 1989), *cert. denied,* 493 U.S. 1058 (1990) (unpublished
 — not citable as precedent) (“The recitation of an additional advantage associated
 with doing what the prior art suggests does not lend patentability to an otherwise
 unpatentable invention.”). 

*In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972) and *In re Dillon,* 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 discussed in **[MPEP
 § 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)** are also pertinent to this issue. 

See **[MPEP § 716.02](s716.html#d0e92844)** - **[§ 716.02(g)](s716.html#d0e93296)** for a discussion of
 declaratory evidence alleging unexpected results. 

**III.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART DEVICES ARE NOT PHYSICALLY COMBINABLE**

“It is well-established that a determination of obviousness based on
 teachings from multiple references does not require an actual, physical substitution of
 elements.” *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1332, 103 USPQ2d 1219, 1226
 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing *In re Etter,* 756 F.2d 852, 859, 225 USPQ 1,
 6 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (*en banc*)) (“Etter's assertions that Azure cannot
 be incorporated in Ambrosio are basically irrelevant, the criterion being not whether
 the references could be physically combined but whether the claimed inventions are
 rendered obvious by the teachings of the prior art as a whole.”). See also *In
 re Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 425, 208 USPQ 871, 881 (CCPA 1981) (“The test for
 obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily
 incorporated into the structure of the primary reference.... Rather, the test is what
 the combined teachings of those references would have suggested to those of ordinary
 skill in the art.”); *In re Sneed,* 710 F.2d 1544, 1550, 218 USPQ 385,
 389 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (“[I]t is not necessary that the inventions of the references be
 physically combinable to render obvious the invention under review.”); and *In
 re Nievelt,* 482 F.2d 965, 179 USPQ 224, 226 (CCPA 1973) (“Combining the teachings of references does not involve an ability to combine
 their specific structures.”). 

However, the claimed combination cannot change the principle of
 operation of the primary reference or render the reference inoperable for its intended
 purpose. See **[MPEP
 § 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI. 

**IV.** **ARGUING AGAINST REFERENCES INDIVIDUALLY**

**One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the
 rejections are based on combinations of references**. *In re
 Keller,* 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981); *In re Merck &
 Co., Inc.,* 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Where a rejection
 of a claim is based on two or more references, a reply that is limited to what a subset
 of the applied references teaches or fails to teach, or that fails to address the
 combined teaching of the applied references may be considered to be an argument that
 attacks the reference(s) individually. Where an applicant’s reply establishes that each
 of the applied references fails to teach a limitation and addresses the combined
 teachings and/or suggestions of the applied prior art, the reply as a whole does not
 attack the references individually as the phrase is used in *Keller* and reliance on *Keller* would not be appropriate. This is because
 “[T]he test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the references would have
 suggested to [a PHOSITA].” *In re Mouttet,* 686 F.3d 1322, 1333, 103
 USPQ2d 1219, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2012). 

**V.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF REFERENCES COMBINED**

Reliance on a large number of references in a rejection does not,
 without more, weigh against the obviousness of the claimed invention. *In re
 Gorman,* 933 F.2d 982, 18 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Court affirmed a
 rejection of a detailed claim to a candy sucker shaped like a thumb on a stick based on
 thirteen prior art references.). 

**VI.** **ARGUING LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE NOT CLAIMED**

Although the claims are interpreted in light of the specification,
 limitations from the specification are not read into the claims. *In re Van
 Geuns,* 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Claims to a
 superconducting magnet which generates a “uniform magnetic field” were not limited to
 the degree of magnetic field uniformity required for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
 imaging. Although the specification disclosed that the claimed magnet may be used in an
 NMR apparatus, the claims were not so limited.); *Constant v. Advanced
 Micro-Devices, Inc.,* 848 F.2d 1560, 1571-72, 7 USPQ2d 1057, 1064-1065 (Fed.
 Cir.), *cert. denied,* 488 U.S. 892 (1988) (Various limitations on
 which appellant relied were not stated in the claims; the specification did not provide
 evidence indicating these limitations must be read into the claims to give meaning to
 the disputed terms.); *Ex parte McCullough,* 7 USPQ2d 1889, 1891 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1987) (Claimed electrode was rejected as obvious despite
 assertions that electrode functions differently than would be expected when used in
 nonaqueous battery since “although the demonstrated results may be germane to the
 patentability of a battery containing appellant’s electrode, they are not germane to the
 patentability of the invention claimed on appeal.”). 

See **[MPEP
 § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** - **[§ 2116.01](s2116.html#d0e201660)**, for additional case law
 relevant to claim interpretation. 

**VII.** **ARGUING ECONOMIC INFEASIBILITY**

The fact that a "combination would not be made by businessmen for
 economic reasons" does not mean that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not
 make the combination because of some technological incompatibility. *In re
 Farrenkopf,* 713 F.2d 714, 718, 219 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Prior art
 reference taught that addition of inhibitors to radioimmunoassay is the most convenient,
 but costliest solution to stability problem. The court held that the additional expense
 associated with the addition of inhibitors would not discourage one of ordinary skill in
 the art from seeking the convenience expected therefrom.). 

**VIII.** **ARGUING ABOUT THE AGE OF REFERENCES**

“The mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness
 of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge
 of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.” *In re
 Wright,* 569 F.2d 1124, 1127, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977) (100 year old
 patent was properly relied upon in a rejection based on a combination of references.).
 See also *Ex parte Meyer,* 6 USPQ2d 1966 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1988) (length of time between the issuance of prior art patents relied upon (1920 and
 1976) was not persuasive of nonobviousness). 

**IX.** **ARGUING THAT PRIOR ART IS NONANALOGOUS**

See **[MPEP
 § 2141.01(a)](s2141.html#d0e208985)** for case law pertaining to analogous art. 

**X.** **ARGUING IMPROPER RATIONALES FOR COMBINING REFERENCES**

-
***A.***  ***Impermissible Hindsight***

Applicants may argue that the examiner’s conclusion of obviousness
 is based on improper hindsight reasoning. However, “[a]ny judgment on obviousness is
 in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based on hindsight reasoning, but so long as
 it takes into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary skill in
 the art at the time the claimed invention was made and does not include knowledge
 gleaned only from applicant’s disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper.” *In re McLaughlin,* 443 F.2d 1392, 1395, 170 USPQ 209, 212 (CCPA
 1971). “A factfinder should be aware, of course, of the distortion caused by
 hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. . .
 . Rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however,
 are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.” *KSR Int'l
 Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007)
 (internal quotations omitted). Applicants may also argue that the combination of two
 or more references is “hindsight” because “express” motivation to combine the
 references is lacking. However, there is no requirement that an “express, written
 motivation to combine must appear in prior art references before a finding of
 obviousness.” *Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co.,* 357 F.3d 1270, 1276, 69
 USPQ2d 1686, 1690 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 402, 82
 USPQ2d at 1389 (“The diversity of inventive pursuits and of modern technology
 counsels against confining the obviousness analysis by a formalistic conception of
 the words teaching, suggestion, and motivation, or by overemphasizing the importance
 of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.”) See also *Uber Techs., Inc. v. X One, Inc.,* 957 F.3d 1334, 1339-40, 2020
 USPQ2d 10476 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (“[W]e hold that the Board erred when it determined
 that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to combine
 the teachings of Okubo with Konishi's server-side plotting to render obvious the
 limitation ‘software ... to transmit the map with plotted locations to the first
 individual.’ This combination does not represent ‘impermissible hindsight’…. Rather,
 because Okubo's terminal-side plotting and Konishi's server-side plotting were both
 well known in the art, and were the only two identified, predictable solutions for
 transmitting a map and plotting locations, it would have been obvious to substitute
 server-side plotting for terminal-side plotting in a combination of Okubo and
 Konishi.”). 

See **[MPEP § 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)** and **[§
 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)** for guidance regarding establishment of a *prima facie* case of obviousness. 

***B.***  ***Obvious To Try Rationale***

An applicant may argue the examiner is applying an improper “obvious
 to try” rationale in support of an obviousness rejection. 

An “obvious to try” rationale may support a conclusion that a claim
 would have been obvious where one skilled in the art is choosing from a finite number
 of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success. “ [A]
 person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or
 her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely that
 product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that
 instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was
 obvious under **[§
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.” *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550
 U.S. 398, 421, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1397 (2007). 

“The admonition that ‘obvious to try’ is not the standard under **[§
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** has been directed mainly at two kinds of error. In some
 cases, what would have been ‘obvious to try’ would have been to vary all parameters
 or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at a successful
 result, where the prior art gave either no indication of which parameters were
 critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be
 successful.... In others, what was ‘obvious to try’ was to explore a new technology
 or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation, where the
 prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed
 invention or how to achieve it.” *In re O’Farrell,* 853 F.2d 894,
 903, 7 USPQ2d 1673, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted) (The court held the
 claimed method would have been obvious over the prior art relied upon because one
 reference contained a detailed enabling methodology, a suggestion to modify the prior
 art to produce the claimed invention, and evidence suggesting the modification would
 be successful.). 

***C.***  ***Lack of Suggestion To Combine References***

A teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine references that is
 found in the prior art is an appropriate rationale for determining obviousness. *KSR,* 550 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396. However, it is just
 one of a number of valid rationales for doing so. The Court in *KSR* identified several exemplary rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness which
 are consistent with the proper “functional approach” to the determination of
 obviousness as laid down in *Graham.**KSR,* 550 U.S. at 415-21, 82 USPQ2d at 1395-97. See **[MPEP §
 2141](s2141.html#d0e208143)** and **[§ 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**. 

***D.***  ***References Teach Away from the Invention or Render Prior Art
 Unsatisfactory for Intended Purpose***

In addition to the material below, see **[MPEP § 2141.02](s2141.html#d0e209106)** (prior art must be considered in its entirety, including disclosures that teach away
 from the claims) and **[MPEP § 2143.01](s2143.html#d0e210245)**, subsection VI (proposed modification
 cannot render the prior art unsatisfactory for its intended purpose or change the
 principle of operation of a reference). 

**1.** **The Nature of the Teaching Is Highly
 Relevant**

A prior art reference that “teaches away” from the claimed
 invention is a significant factor to be considered in determining obviousness.
 However, “the nature of the teaching is highly relevant and must be weighed in
 substance. A known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply
 because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the
 same use.” *In re**Gurley,* 27 F.3d 551, 553, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994)
 (Claims were directed to an epoxy resin based printed circuit material. A prior
 art reference disclosed a polyester-imide resin based printed circuit material,
 and taught that although epoxy resin based materials have acceptable stability and
 some degree of flexibility, they are inferior to polyester-imide resin based
 materials. The court held the claims would have been obvious over the prior art
 because the reference taught epoxy resin based material was useful for the
 inventor’s purpose, applicant did not distinguish the claimed epoxy from the prior
 art epoxy, and applicant asserted no discovery beyond what was known to the
 art.). 

Furthermore, “the prior art’s mere disclosure of more than one
 alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives
 because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the
 solution claimed….” *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73
 USPQ2d 1141, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See also *UCB, Inc. v. Actavis Labs,
 UT, Inc.,* 65 F.4th 679, 692, 2023 USPQ2d 448 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (“a
 reference does not teach away if it merely expresses a general preference for an
 alternative invention but does not criticize, discredit or otherwise discourage
 investigation into the invention claimed.”) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting *DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,* 567 F.3d
 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009)); and *Schwendimann v. Neenah, Inc.,* 82 F.4th 1371, 1381, 2023 USPQ2d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (“Although Oez [the prior
 art] used a white pigment with a cross-linking polymer, it does not discourage a
 skilled artisan from using the white pigment without a cross-linking polymer or
 lead the skilled artisan in a direction divergent from the path taken in the
 Appealed Patents. Thus, Oez's disclosure is substantial evidence that supports the
 Board's finding that Oez does not teach away from the proposed combination.”). 

**2.** **References Cannot Be Combined Where Reference Teaches Away from Their
 Combination**

It is improper to combine references where the references teach
 away from their combination. *In re Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731,
 743, 218 USPQ 769, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (The claimed catalyst which contained both
 iron and an alkali metal was not suggested by the combination of a reference which
 taught the interchangeability of antimony and alkali metal with the same
 beneficial result, combined with a reference expressly excluding antimony from,
 and adding iron to, a catalyst.). 

**3.** **Proceeding Contrary to Accepted Wisdom Is Evidence of Nonobviousness**

The totality of the prior art must be considered, and proceeding
 contrary to accepted wisdom in the art is evidence of nonobviousness. *In
 re Hedges,* 783 F.2d 1038, 228 USPQ 685 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Applicant’s
 claimed process for sulfonating diphenyl sulfone at a temperature above 127ºC was
 contrary to accepted wisdom because the prior art as a whole suggested using lower
 temperatures for optimum results as evidenced by charring, decomposition, or
 reduced yields at higher temperatures.). 

Furthermore, “[k]nown disadvantages in old devices which would
 naturally discourage search for new inventions may be taken into account in
 determining obviousness.” *United States v. Adams,* 383 U.S. 39,
 52, 148 USPQ 479, 484 (1966). 

***E.***  ***Applicability of KSR to All Technologies***

At the time the *KSR* decision was
 handed down, some observers questioned whether the principles discussed were intended
 by the Supreme Court to apply to all fields of inventive endeavor. Arguments were
 made that because the technology at issue in *KSR* involved the
 relatively well-developed and predictable field of vehicle pedal assemblies, the
 decision was relevant only to such fields. The Federal Circuit has soundly repudiated
 such a notion, stating that *KSR* applies across technologies: 
> This court also declines to cabin KSR to the
> “predictable arts” (as opposed to the “unpredictable art” of biotechnology). In
> fact, this record shows that one of skill in this advanced art would find these
> claimed “results” profoundly “predictable.”

*In re Kubin,* 561 F.3d 1351, 1360, 90 USPQ2d 1417, 1424 (Fed. Cir.
 2009). Thus, Office personnel should not withdraw any rejection solely on the basis
 that the invention lies in a technological area ordinarily considered to be
 unpredictable. See also **[MPEP § 2143.02](s2143.html#d0e210414)**. 

**XI.** **FORM PARAGRAPHS**

See **[MPEP
 § 707.07(f)](s707.html#d0e74561)** for form paragraphs **[7.37](#fp7.37)** through **[7.38](#fp7.38)** which may be used where applicant’s
 arguments are not persuasive or are moot.
